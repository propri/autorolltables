      "A rain cloud begins to follow the party as they travel.",
      "A talking owl appears before the party and offers to guide them through a vine-tangled forest in exchange for “a shiny bauble.”",
      "The trees are major gossips. As you walk through them the party member with the highest passive perception is sure they can hear the whispers in the rustling of the leaves. If you tell the trees a juicy secret that no-one else knows they will open the path to wherever you wish to go. The trees will rustle outwardly from the tree you told the secret too as it tells the other trees next to it.",
      "A bloody pile of corpses lay ahead of you. After approaching them they sit up, dispel the illusions, and the assorted fey all run off laughing.",
      "A fey fighting exhibition. Many of the fey, when slain in the fey realms, simply appear once more alive some time after, be it a few hours or days later (unless executed by the Fey courts, or special preparations taken by the combatants to ensure death) -- as such, fighting exhibitions can quickly become bloody, brutal affairs, but with little lasting consequence to the participants. It is also not uncommon for fey fighters to pull forth concealed weaponry, and it being totally within the rules of the ring to do so. Mortals participating in these fights do not have such protection as almost-guaranteed resurrection.",
      "The party encounters a stretch of rocky terrain which proves very difficult to walk through. The stretch ends abruptly at a sheer cliff, over the edge of which there appears to be a grassy forest growing out sideways. Looking back, the party suddenly realizes they've been walking up a sheer cliff.",
      "Fey prisoners cruelly collared with cold-iron, toiling as slaves in the Fey Queen's vineyards of Celestial grapes (the only such fields remaining since the sinking of Atlantis).",
      "A giant caterpillar offers a toke from their bubble pipe. Creatures that imbibe, and are not firmly attached to the ground, begin to float away.",
      "The Feywild is mutable and ever changing, and the Queen's Palace is no exception. While the party is traversing the Feywild, they come across a Museum Gallery Wing juxtaposed with the other normal terrain nearby. Subtle owl motifs emerge, (and aside from the nearly perfect weather and lighting conditions) the only clues to the change are that statues and artworks appear out of the ground as if inextricably part of the natural landscape. This particular wing is a bit overgrown, and guarded by 1d3+1 Guardian Portrait from Curse of Strahd and 1d4 Animated Armor. For a higher level encounter, add a Stone Cursed from Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes, a Clay Gladiator from Tomb of Annihilation, or a Caryatid Column from 3e Fiend Folio. Despite the overgrown nature, mere mortals shall never gaze upon the works of art and beauty the Queen holds dear, making trespassing here very dangerous.",
      "An innocent woodchuck stands and stares at the party while eating from a vegetable garden from the local witch. The local witch finally catches them in the act and punishes the woodchuck with a curse.",
      "They stumble upon a group of fey having a tea party with a random assortment of forest creatures. There are several seats open and they gleefully invite the party over to enjoy some drinks and snacks. It may or not be a friendly encounter.",
      "A funeral hosted by the Seelie court that is gathering before a mighty parade. All who pass by are magically charmed into following the procession, and seemingly throw themselves into re-enacting (sometimes violently) scenes from the life and times of the deceased.",
      "2d4 fairies are following behind the party. Whenever the party looks behind or seems to be getting wise they hide. They're quite oblivious however, and if snuck up on can be heard making bets about which party member will get eaten by the beast ahead/get the most lost in the forest/follow the wisps etc.",
      "An owlbear in a fine hat, and vest with a golden pocket watch. The owlbear is friendly, but has a smoking problem and is addicted to halfling tobacco. It does not appear to be a threat, except on moonless nights, when it grows 4 times as large and becomes an unstoppable rage-filled killer.",
      "A chipmunk playfully hops on a field of large mushrooms that have a natural bounce to them. One of the larger mushrooms gets irritated and tries to teach this chipmunk a lesson in not pestering others.",
      "A crossroads where all signs point to the same destination (where the players have most recently departed from). Any locals (when asked for directions) will announce: 'Oh, you can't get there from here, I'm afraid, you'll have to go backwards, you see.. sometimes going backwards is the only way to move forwards, my grandpapa would always say..'",
      "A friendly tin automaton in a copse of hazel trees, wielding an ax and a flute made from a metal jug and a funnel. The automaton playing the flute causes the copse of hazel to quickly grow into the shape of large, fine, living cages, which the automaton uses the ax to cut down. Careful observation of the automaton's chest might reveal dried blood, opening the chest reveals a beating heart. Once a month, when the moon is full, the automaton is driven to kill, in order to replace the heart.",
      "A veritable mountainous bower of house sized flower petals covers the ground, forming a pile literally the size of a small mountain, and reeking of lovely perfume fragrance. At the center of the pile, seemingly placed lovingly, is the corpse of a gargantuan bumblebee mount, with fine saddle and tackle, barding, etc. sized for a humanoid or possibly even a large creature to ride. It is covered in 'giant' (small sized) fire-ants, literally ants that burn with flame, and surrounded by towering tree-sized poles of smoking incense. It is difficult to tell if the ants are devouring the corpse, or guarding it; perhaps it is both.",
      "A city-state sized hive of giant, anthropomorphic bees, living inside the festering corpse of an even larger gargantuan lion. Their honey is claimed to be much prized by the Unseelie queen.",
      "A large river blocks the party's path. A dryad nearby has a boat, but it's taken root and she's struggling to convince it to go back out onto the water. A loud snap and the sudden disappearance of a moose that was drinking on the other bank prove swimming a dangerous course of action.",
      "A flock of half-sized miniature black kenku, a too tall fey with several extra joints, and a clockwork wagon piled high with fine trade goods. The kenku are skilled crafters, and on the wagon are portable workshops of many kinds, including a miniature blacksmith forge, a wind-up loom, potter's wheel, kiln, and apothecary. The skinny fey is dressed as an undertaker, all in black, their lips and eyes have been sewn closed, and their long fingers end in sewing needles a foot long. They have a set of extra joints in between each joint a normal humanoid possesses, and appear to be double-jointed, at that. The fey offers tailoring of outfits, and sells everything from silken robes woven by spiders, to transparent gowns made of only large dragonfly wings.",
      "A lovely orchestra made up of fey creatures. They carry traditional musical instruments, such as the violin or the flute. They all are very posh and elegant, and inform the party that they are going to see the fairy queen. If the party asks to hear the music, they put on a performance. The twist, all music is very loud, sweary, and is rock music.",
      "A night-sky so beautiful you get drunk, literally, taking it all in.",
      "A group of friendly bogles are about to start a game with water balloons, and invite the players to participate. Participants mustn't leave a magically marked area of the forest, and the winner is the last person standing who hasn't been hit by a balloon. Bogles can and will use their special ability to warp around the place at opportune times.",
      "A fey noble carried around on a palanquin, except the bearers are all on ridiculously tall stilts.",
      "A coven of seven platinum haired and silver skinned automaton sisters with carved gems for eyes, serene expressions, fine features, and silk-lined robes of samite and ermine. The sisters sit atop white horses, but do not speak, instead the horses speak for them, asking the way to the Capital city. If the horses are offered whiskey, they will happily reveal that they are from the moon and on a diplomatic envoy mission.",
      "Loud music and vocal commotion is heard underneath a thick range of a colorful forest. A vegetable, honey, or herb conference/con is seen with many booths and dressed up forest creatures and fey perusing the countless amount of goods, experts, and trinkets as they revel in fandom and nerdiness.",
      "As you pass through a swarm of dragonflies a sprite approaches and angrily accuses you of interrupting their parade. They demand recompense in the form of one good deed, freely given.",
      "There is a rectangular hole in the ground surrounded by cut stone. There is no visible water and the walls are dark with ash. A small head pops out from the side and asks if they are there to deliver their presents. If they don't throw down a present the child's head will start to climb the chimney and is revealed to be a creature who steals faces.",
      "The mutable nature of the feywild extends to other Arch Fey's Palatial Estates as well. While the party is traversing the Feywild, they come across a wing of an Arch Fey's palace resembling a Greco-Romantic Boudoir juxtaposed (but also elegantly entwined) with the other normal terrain nearby. A copse of dryads in humanoid form are Ladies in Waiting for the Arch Fey, the players suddenly find them in a compromised position, and much embarrassment is had by all. The players must not be caught by the Arch-fey's Guards, however, or the fun will end. 1d6+1 Blink Dogs and 1d2+1 Yeth Hounds from Volo's Guide to Monsters hunt the party through the halls and gardens, along with a Forlarren (from Mordenkainen’s Fiendish Folio Volume I) and 1d4 Twigjacks converted from Pathfinder Bestiary 2. All the pursuing searchers wear the Arch Fey's Livery, and aim to kill half of the party, and capture, interrogate, and then torture the rest to death.",
      "An impassable river in a deep and dangerous gorge with a single bridge guarded by a peerless warrior who threatens to throw off the bridge any who cross without first speaking absolute truth. Traffic is quite backed up.",
      "The party comes across a circular stream, roughly 100 feet in diameter, crossed by two footbridges. Going under either of the bridges leads to another identical stream somewhere else. The stream goes through 1d4 such portals before returning to the original circle.",
      "A majestic imperial stag fully 50 hands tall, bearing a rack of antlers with at least 24 points. The stag wears a collar with a gold sigil of the Fey Queen. It escorts a harem of at least twenty does, of similar size, and a herd of much smaller 'normal' sized hart and hind trail behind. The ground beneath the majestic creatures seems to grow more verdant, lush, and covered in fresh growth as they traverse it.",
      "A headless knight has been wandering the area, feeling around for his head.",
      "A column of Hedgehog Knights; The Order of the Night Quill, literally small awakened hedgehogs in knightly accoutrement riding upon roosters as mounts. The Knights are fighting a much larger and more powerful enemy, pretending to not need any assistance, despite contrary evidence.",
      "A wildly drunk satyr sits atop a fallen log hurling insults at passersby, the crude words transform into barbed daggers mid-air.",
      "A group of children wearing strange faded masks and eating cake and drinking lemonade. If approached they refuse to share.",
      "An hag traveling in a house-wagon, with a celestial angel enslaved and imprisoned. The angel has had their wings removed.",
      "The Feywild has its own version of every biome in the Material Plane, and sometimes more than one, and often very very wild. The Feywild Ocean is particularly mercurial, occasionally 'deciding' to move inland. Seemingly overnight, the terrain the party is on becomes a very small island in a very large sea. Locals take this in stride, adapting as if it were any other day. This progresses for 1d6 days, before reverting to its former state, leaving the players once more in whatever biome they were in before the ocean moved.",
      "A terrified looking person is found balancing a goblet on their head filled to the brim with water. They will plead for the party to help them. They explain that a fey puts the goblet there and that if a single drop of water falls from the goblet they will die. They have been standing there for quite some time, and are terrified to attempt to remove the goblet. Examination of the water or goblet reveals it is ordinary, and if any of it spills nothing happens. The poor soul has been tricked by mischievous Fey.",
      "You come across a large number of fey creatures towing along various mounts (some griffons, a unicorn, etc) who are friendly to the players. If asked what they are doing, they tell the players they are organizing a race, and invite the players to join. Players can either run, use their own mounts (any & all are accepted) or they can rent a mount for a certain amount of gold. In total, about 100 fey creatures compete in the race, and will use underhand tactics to win",
      "A school of literally flying fish, blown far inland by a squall. The fish are medium to large sized creatures (use the stats of a shark) and can hunt ground based prey.",
      "A forest fire, set by a giant wolf made of ash and flame, in hot pursuit of spectral, god-sized prey, and some say, its long-lost mate. The wolf is accompanied by a large pack of smaller ash-wolves, who tend to attack and surround prey of their own. The creatures can speak, and at least one of them is a Shifter Druid and can be reasoned with, and they venerate the giant ash wolf, following the fires it starts, making hunting easier.",
      "The players come across a beautiful clearing in the woods that the denizens refer to as 'The Dancing Grove'. A massive tree sits in the middle of the clearing, with musical instruments made of sticks, twigs, and reeds dangling from its branches. Every full moon, the massive tree comes alive and begins playing all of the instruments at once, creating some of the most beautiful music the players have ever heard. Creatures from all around come to the Dancing Grove to hear the enchanting music.",
      "A fresh race course has been staked out overnight magically, and Fey well-to-do have gathered. The race involves each owner's horse being carried around the track by the owners' stablehands and servants. At least one will keel over, dead from exhaustion.",
      "A convoy of caged humanoid (non-fey) children and fey guards pass the players. They are destined to be delivered to one of the Nine Hells every seven years.",
      "A group of fey sit around a strangely colored fire at night telling scary stories and allow the group to join. The time comes for your party to share. Be careful what stories you tell, it might come to pass around you.",
      "A crossroads encounter with a number of fey threatening what appears to be wealthy humanoids who owe a debt. The fey are very restrained, civil, and polite, but they are a real threat, and are emissaries from a group of fey who perform assassinations for hire in the mortal world, and know of a way to easily transit between the realms, at least reliably enough to kidnap wealthy individuals and threaten them at a fey-crossroad! The fey threats have names like: 'Herb Robert' (They are the spokesman, also known as 'Death-Comes-Quickly'), 'Johnny Jump-up', 'Black-eyed Susan', 'Jack-in-the-Pulpit', and 'Golden Alexander', and each wear a flower matching their name, and in some way reflect the plant they are named for.",
      "A massive group of satyrs are having a wild party in the woods. The surrounding creatures are getting concerned, because a satyr party can easily spin out of control.",
      "The players meet an extremely kind and helpful fey that, unbeknownst to them, has the ability to demand favors in return for any favors they give. The fey will attempt to get characters as much on their debt as they can with food, shelter, hospitality and perhaps even fending off some wild creatures for them, and the favors it asks can't be ignored by the players, as if they were under the effects of a powerful spell. However, the fey limits its requests to silly things that would get you laughed at.",
      "A Faun is sitting in the ruins of an old manor house with a few sprites near him. He’s drawing patterns on the ground with chaLk.",
      "A mining settlement inside of the corpse of a beyond-gargantuan elemental comprised of once-living gemstone. Multiple levels of glittering gemstone have been carved into spectacular, if grisly cathedrals and vaults. The Queen of the Fey has ordered the mine to move the entire corpse and turn it into a new palace, but it has become infested with gemstone themed spirits that slaughter anyone who disturbs them.",
      "The players spot a group of animated shrubs that are talking in common, plotting world domination. However, they lack the wits, resources and manpower to pull it off in any conceivable way, and all but the leader can be scared off pretty easily. The leader is likely to hold a grudge if the party messes with the gathering.",
      "The party encounters a large pond. Any reflection in the pond appears to be aged several decades (the party will appear older, objects appear to have been weathered. This even applies to the surroundings: trees will appear taller than they are.)",
      "A rare species of rabbit that can comprehend most languages. Their unique fur changes color from white to a blue-ish black, matching the phases of the moon, and they also grow in size, starting as normal rabbits on a new moon and eventually growing to large size during a full moon. Greedy hunters might be searching the forest in order to harvest their extremely valuable pelts.",
      "A disguised hag invites the party to dinner. The food continuously refills and if they succeed on a DC15 wisdom saving throw they will realize that it continually feels like the start of the meal. Trying to get up will reveal their feet stuck to the legs of the chairs.",
      "A village of humanoids with heads that look like those of dogs. Farmers of this village are in an uproar; they are harvesting the fruit of a plant that grows humanoids and is a much sought after delicacy at the tables of both the Seelie and Unseelie courts. A humanoid (in all appearances human) runs up to the party and requests sanctuary, attempting to hide the fact that they have a portion of vine growing from her belly button.",
      "A mischievous elf is posing as a traveling merchant of common items sold at an incredibly cheap price. All items are cursed in a mildly frustrating way.",
      "The players are struck by an intoxicating sweet smell (may require WIS saving throws). Those affected by its hunger inducing effect are attracted to a leaf covered area. The most perceptive (not affected) players will understand that when stepping on the region they'll fall onto a giant venus flytrap. If no one falls to the trap, the flytrap will act all indignant and flippant that it produced that sweet smell for nothing. That the contract has been made and it wasn't getting its share back. Says it will start raising a vine dome until either one of the PCs sacrifices himself or they toss some sort of food to the trap's cup.",
      "Giant land-whales with mouths the size of football fields seemingly made of wood, wicker, and brambles. They appear overnight and are seemingly 'beached' miles from any ocean and dying. Inside their mouths and gullets are countless species of rare or extinct sea creatures, many still alive (albeit not for long).",
      "A field filled with what appear to be brick ovens of all shapes and sizes. Many are burning or still hot, crewed by a flock of black feathered kenku bandits who favor fire-based attacks. The ovens grow naturally, it seems, but the bandits cut down the queen's forests to fuel them, and seem to spread and grow in number each time a new oven is lit.",
      "The party finds themselves on a clearing where a number of colorful mushrooms equal to the party's size (4 players = 4 mushrooms) are growing. They can't leave the clearing unless they eat the mushrooms. If they try they will walk for a while and inevitably find themselves back on the clearing. GM digression what happens when they eat the shrooms.",
      "A warforged is chopping wood near a cottage. Curled up on the steps of the cottage is a lion.",
      "Instead of a static town or village, settlements and cities in the Feywild are more like metaphorical boats being swept along a current, the locations of buildings relative to each other change frequently as does their location in the world but they somehow manage to be relatively near each other as needed. However sometimes a building or two will break from the herd and go its own way; one normally close location is now further away, and seemingly doesn't want to be found, and the Players have been tasked with tracking it down and possibly leading it (the instructions are vague) back to the city proper!",
      "While walking through the forest, an argument can be heard up ahead. If the party investigates, they find two ancient Eladrin engaged in a battle of wits. They are currently arguing about who can tell the longest story, and they want the party to judge.",
      "A giant mushroom around 200ft tall, that exerts a strange gravity effect, letting players walk up the stem. An old hermit lives in a grotto among the gills.",
      "The party encounters a colony of house-cats who walk on their hind-legs like people do. Today there is a parade, where they pick the new king. The old king and the new king are both at either ends of the parade on palanquins. They must joust to determine the victor, but first, games of chance, and a civilized feast!",
      "Snow begins to fall from a clear sky. As soon as the last bit of ground is covered, all fey creatures begin digging at the snow, which is somehow several inches, or even feet, deep. They begin pulling fruit from beneath the snow, with white skin and purple meat. The fey alternate between gorging themselves with the fruit and using them as projectiles and weapons against others in a joyous frolicking melee. If consumed, the fruit's texture is that of a medium-rare steak and has an alternating flavor that moves from tangerine to pear and back. Eating the fruit grants a feeling of warm youthful days playing with friends by the river. After 10 minutes the snow on the ground clears as though it was never there. Any fruit kept lasts 6d12 hours before disintegrating into sparkling dust with a slight toot and a child's laughter.",
      "A fine carriage, drawn by deep shadows, and a driver hell bent for leather, stopping at nothing, for fear of their own life, even going so far as to smash through barricades, or attack anyone attempting to stop them. It either runs down the players, or crashes near them...",
      "A queen's finest fighting force of guards, wearing magical bronze armor that looks like the heads of owls, and grants flight, fly by overhead in formation. Local fey cower in fear and try to hide.",
      "A school of floating airborne goldfish whose scales are literally gold pieces. Catching and killing the fish causes it to revert to a regular fish. Capturing the fish and selling it alive is worth 10 gp each.",
      "A small trickling stream about a foot in width is impossible to pass. The flowers nearby will tell you the stream is very up itself and wants tribute to allow you to cross. They mimic the river in a silly voice 'Give me your silver. Give me your breath. Give me the sounds of your step.'",
      "The Feywild hosts a twisted fun-house mirror version of every biome on the material plane, and then some. One second the party is in the civilized farm-land portions of the Feywild, and the next in a dazzling colored prismatic desert made of crystals and finest of pure white sand; beset upon by 1d2 Crystalline Trolls guarding a small patch of ordinary wildflowers! (Beneath the wildflowers is a single Perfect Astral Gem worth 2d20x100gp, from which another Troll will spawn in a few years...) Should the party continue on towards where the nearest civilized outpost would have been located in Farmland, they find that the locals treat the changed situation as if it were any other Fwendniday, except everyone's clothing has magically shifted style to match the desert theme...",
      "A flying boat and crew, filled with a catch of flying fish. The crew are eager to get to market before the fish are spoiled. The captain, 'Great-Uncle Penderfish' keeps giving the smolt sweetbreads...",
      "Ultraviolet technicolor gnomes wearing bowler hats in gangs, riding giant flying hummingbird mounts, launching air attacks on passersby.",
      "A hag offers the party a vial of acid for 20 GP, and demonstrates its destructive capabilities by using her hand as an example (the hand grows back after 1d4 hours). If the party decides to buy it, anything they dissolve with the acid turns into some kind of juice.",
      "A lovely park table and set of benches set with a fine and intricately carved set of jeweled game pieces for a strange 13 by 13 square type of chessboard with 46 pieces each. A lifelike statue of a player sits on one bench, with the board in an early-mid game state. Moving a tile triggers the curse. The secret trick is that each side is petrified while it is not their turn, until a winner is chosen. A non-petrified player may leave the game, and unfortunately, until it is finished, the other player may not be unstuck.",
      "Eleven, faceless Fey priests celebrating an obscure festival to an extinct eleven-faced deity. The entire fey countryside is gathered around a well set beneath a decrepit statue of the ancient god, with eleven faces in different directions and strange expressions. Surrounding the well in a perfect circle is a copse of Larch with dry, golden leaves, and ten of the faceless priests have tied themselves up inside the branches. The eleventh though, refuses, and is fighting with the crowd.",
      "The party comes across a field of giant pumpkins the size of houses. A few of the pumpkins have strange music playing from near or inside them. A fey field-worker struggles to set up an instrument and loudspeaker combination, alternately moving mindlessly, and then humming whatever music matches coming from the giant gourds.",
      "A solitary willow sister can be seen dancing around her willow tree, attempting to revive it. The tree is covered in a bright red fungus, and looks to be heavily infected. The willow sister pleads with the party for aid.",
      "A field full of patches of Glimmergrass, tall grass patches of glass-like iridescent plants. A creature within 5 feet of a specific patch of Glimmergrass has the effect of Mirror Image, unless they already have an effect like it active (in which case no additional effect occurs). The effect of anything within the fields is like stepping into a maze full of funhouse mirrors. A hunting party of 1d6+1 goblinoids stalk the fields.",
      "A vicious continent-spanning flock of starlings, nightingales, and whippoorwills with razor sharp beaks, claws, and booming calls. Those who hear the birds know to seek shelter quickly. The fools who stay out in such a flight are quickly doomed and likely never seen again!",
      "The party arrives at a forest that has come alive. Each of the trees has a soul and talks to the party, and if the party looks at one of the leaves, they will see the veins forming the picture of a little room inside the leaf, and a little leaf dude sitting at his table for afternoon tea.",
      "2d6 Red-Skinned Satyrs wearing 'fake' Devil costumes and wielding mining equipment. At least one is either a Sorcerer or Warlock, or a Forlarren from Mordenkainen’s Fiendish Folio Volume I . When not aggressively attacking anyone nearby they are busy digging into a set of beyond-gargantuan teeth embedded in the ground like one half of a giant mouth. The 'devils' seem intent on causing cavities and tooth decay in the giant teeth, and are aggressive to anyone who approaches. They have been cursed/charmed to be this way. However, in addition to being cursed and humiliated, they have also been cursed with illusory dental-pain that exactly mirrors the damage they deal to the giant teeth. Those who approach within 60 feet of any afflicted must make a Moderate DC Wisdom save each round or be forced to participate in the cavity causing activity, those who succeed on the save are immune for 1 hour. Additionally, each round, the illusory dental pain may be resisted with a second Moderate DC Wisdom save. Those that succeed on that save are immune to the effect for 1 hour as well. The illusory pain affects Concentration checks as if receiving 3d6 hp worth of damage (but it does not deal actual damage).",
      "A Fey noble has decided that he doesn't want to be a noble any longer. He recruits the party to show him how to be more of a 'commoner'.",
      "The Pied Piper, yes, that one... fresh from returning after stealing away the rats and children of Hamelin. The children and rats are both here, and the Piper tries to play dumb. But there are political implications to freeing the children. Namely, without them, the Fey realm is in debt to the Nine Hells. A tithe is paid every seven years in the form of children's souls to remain neutral and uninvaded. Interfering will result in incurring the wrath of the Queens.",
      "The mutable nature of the feywild extends to the Queen's Palace as well. While the party is traversing the Feywild, they come across a Royal Wing juxtaposed with the other normal terrain nearby. Beautiful golden screens; priceless, eggshell thin ceramic vases, and polished brass mirrored walls form a sort of whispering gallery, occupied by a Spring Eladrin and an Annis Hag from Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes, along with a number of lesser co-conspirators. They are discussing some sort of curse, assasination, or coup against the Throne. Should they discover the players, they will attempt to capture, then charm the group into obedient thrall.",
      "A huge, but strangely erudite ogre with giant warhammer, and in full magical platemail, challenges all who attempt to pass to single combat.",
      "A gaggle of twenty-score nobly dressed humanoids, each tied at the waist and wrist to another by a silken cord, wearing woven crowns of marigolds, along with a veritable army of fey servants in fine livery keeping herd, many have several blackbirds perched on their shoulders. The servants keep playing the humanoid nobles with wine, sweet-meats, sweet smelling smoke, and are feeding them lotus blossoms, marigolds, and mushrooms. One of each group of noble's servants is wearing fine brocade robes, has an elaborate and imperious head-dress, and seems most versed in magical enchantments. If questioned, the nobles will claim they are headed to a brothel, urge the party to stay, and offer to cover their tab. If questioned, instead, the fey 'in charge' will explain the gaggle are late for a wedding and urge the group to leave them be and stop contributing to the chaos.",
      "A noble minotaur herdsman named Sir Cease, leading his herd of ... wait.. are those people? They look like people, but are twice the size, and have thick curly hair on their heads, and they all have beards. They eat grass like cattle and sound like them too, and none are capable of speaking. They'll fetch a fine price, and might even grace the Queen's table, according to the Herdsman.",
      "The players run into a human that has been cursed by a mischievous fey into thinking they are a cat. This becomes evident when the person does silly things such as wonder out loud how the players can spot them hiding inside a small bush that could never conceal their actual body proportions, or when they attempt and fail to climb trees or walls using their bare hands and feet. If befriended, the person might ask the players to help lift the curse, either by means of a spell or by confronting the fey that cursed them and getting it to remove the curse through some kind of bargain.",
      "Was that a rabbit wearing a waistband and looking at a pocket watch that just hopped by?",
      "A cult of Prometheans, Fey who see the mortals' mastery of iron in religious terms, and seek to claim it for themselves by adopting as many mortal ways as possible. Their cult is small, scattered, but they firmly believe it is growing.",
      "Owls. Everywhere you look, there is at least one. Are they following you? Even inside! The Queen Sees All.",
      "A patch of screaming Mandrake; quite valuable, provided one survives their deathly and deafening screaming. A powerful, crazed dryad guards the grove the patch is located in and hates all creatures, seeing them as fit only for fertilizer, and will actively kill any who approach.",
      "The Queen's Garden is known to be vast; so vast in fact that no single Gardener knows the true extent or boundary of it!

      "A tall ornate column with a continuous spiraling bas-relief depicting multiple scenes of the greatest deeds of an ancient conqueror. On top of the column stands tall a statue of said conqueror wearing a smooth cuirass, with a spear in one hand and a scale in the other he looks far away towards the sunset.",

The half-spheres' rough hewn flat faces are aligned to the center and precisely aimed at the peak of the prism. Close inspection might reveal a 1 inch hole through the center of each sphere, aimed at the point of the prism.",
      "A perfect sphere, about three feet in diameter and made from an unknown metal of some kind. It is polished to a mirror finish. Despite its shape it cannot be rolled, perhaps magically fixed in place.",
      "A fool in motley, seemingly hanging upside down by a noose around their foot. The fool is blindfolded. Through creative artifice in the stone, it seems as though nothing holds the form up, as if it really were suspended by the rope.",

      "This ancient statue is clung with moss and ivy. An elvish warrior-queen gazes northward, toward something no longer apparent, her left hand clasping a cracked crystal ball. Her right hand thrusts out ahead, and appears to have once held a sword. The return of the queen's sword, the party soon learns, is a matter of local legend.",

      "It is a statue of a pyramid of skulls. Or perhaps it is a pyramid of metal-plated skulls?",
      "It’s a statue of a local explorer, holding a telescope to one eye, looking at something in the distance. He traveled the world several decades ago and the villagers will gladly show the party a map of the world where the explorer named everything after himself. Of course, the PCs will only need an easy intelligence check to recognize everything by their real names, like say Waterdeep.",

It is said that a great ancient library once stood on this site before being destroyed by war. Each day the statue displays one of the millions of lost tomes opened to a random page. The legend is that a powerful mage created the statue in an effort to recover some piece of priceless knowledge. Despite checking every day for the rest of their life, the library's collection was so vast that the mage never found what they sought.",

      "A block of Nephrite carved as a scaled, fire-breathing legless wyrm, with eyes made of carnelian, rotating and swallowing miniature humanoids in a brutalist, elemental style. The block is at least 10 feet on each side. The snake twists and turns unpredictably at right angles in three dimensions, filling at least 50 percent of the available space, and masterfully narrows as it's body recedes into the negative space of the stone block's interior, creating a disorienting, and somewhat hypnotic forced perspective, but also revealing the unimpeachable skill and mastery of whomever carved it. It is said that when a storm approaches on moonless nights, the stone somewhat glows.",

      "This statue looks familiar, you realize it’s you! Whoever is looking at the statue sees themselves. Multiple people viewing it together all see themselves.",
      "It is a very realistic statue of a medusa. Are medusae vulnerable to their own kind's petrifying abilities, or is this merely the product of a strange artistic sense?",
      "A knight kneeling before a regal, motherly figure. The knight has an ecstatic expression upon their face gazing up; the regal figure a soothing or relaxed expression gazing down. The regal figure is richly robed, and clearly pregnant, holding a giant key in their right hand, and a large owl in their left. The knight is armored in chainmail, and a scabbard, but the scabbard contains no sword.",
      "It is a statue of a single, heavenly angel descending onto a corpse and guiding its soul into the afterlife.",
      "A weather worn statue of an exaggeratedly pregnant woman, a look of anger or disgust upon her face, using a butter-churn, a rusting iron horseshoe has been nailed near the bottom, leaving a stain. The work is articulated, the arms move up and down, the belly spins to reveal a carving of a demon or imp, and the face of the woman turns to reveal a death's head behind. An inscription, much abbreviated, along the side reads, 'Spoileth Ye Butere'.",
      "From afar it seems like any other small shrub. Upon closer inspection you realize that it is actually a statue made from green stone. Either it was once a living plant that was turned to stone, or it is a stunningly detailed carving that required incredible skill and patience. Despite its delicate appearance, it appears to be in perfect condition with no visible damage.",
      "A stylized whale vomiting forth every type of sea creature in a froth. A tiny caricatured boat and fisherman are trapped in the maelstrom.",
      "A seemingly unfinished work of a humanoid slave struggling to break free from unseen bonds. Only half of the work is carved, as if the humanoid is carving itself out of the stone with its struggle. That which has been revealed from within the stone is masterwork in quality.",
      "Two noblewomen in archaic dress, facing each other, legs a-caper, skirts furled, they intertwine fingers. They appear to be dancing. Their forms are intricately detailed, but their faces are void. One is literally a void, the other is a smooth blank egg shape with an inscrutable rune in the exact center.",
      "A statue of a hero, holding a sword. Some of the arms plating has fallen off, revealing some simple gears. Every morning at 9 the gears try to move - but are blocked by a small stone, making a screeching sound. If the stone is removed the gears work normally, and every 9 AM the hero raises the sword and waves it in the air - before moving it back down.",
      "A fifteen-foot marble wall depicts a great battle in high relief. Dozens of knights and horsemen trample about a beach, clashing with dozens of fishfolk warriors emerging from the sea. The fight appears clumsy, ill-fought and ignoble, and it is unclear which side is supposed to be winning. Bodies of both sides pile up on the sand. Overhead, the sun is eclipsed. A bronze plaque dedicates the relief to the Human-Fishfolk Diplomatic League.",
      "A servant in dishabille carrying a basket of roses is loading a trebuchet with the flowers. The trebuchet uses forced perspective.",
      "A statue of a large ornate goblet that collects rain or any liquid poured inside it. However, it cannot overflow. When the level of the liquid gets close to the rim all of it mysteriously drains rapidly, leaving the goblet empty. No one has yet figured out where the liquid goes or how the mechanism works.",

      "Rough, flat slabs of perfect white marble about two inches thick, and eight feet high by three feet wide, arranged in a sinuous spiral such that each slab is no more than 12 inches apart at the widest point. A perfect, snake-like hole, complete with subtle scale pattern on the inside, and wide enough for a human arm to fit through, spirals in the opposite direction several times through each slab.",
      "A flat disk with seven stars in an arc, one prominently large at the zenith, carved stone vines wrap the plinth but open up to stylized flowers that frame the disk and stars.",
      "A series of imposing spikes at odd and aesthetically displeasing angles. A series of inscriptions along the base in multiple dead and forgotten languages reads, cryptically, 'This is not a place of honor, No esteemed deeds are commemorated here'.",
      "The real heroes, a statue of craftsmen and women of a variety of races making adventuring gear (weapons, armor, kit) on a shared workbench. Items left as tribute will disappear, sometimes reappearing having been made magical.",
      "It is a statue commemorating a famous (yet temporary) alliance. An elf and a dwarf shake hands, respect on their faces.",
      "A freshly used executioner's block and chains, in pristine, sterile black marble. The dripping gore is somehow captured perfectly.",
      "A small, woven basket made of sharp thorns, in the shape of a boat atop a stylized wave-wracked sea. A swaddled baby is inside, along with a long-sword, shield, crown, and orb. The babe is holding a laurel branch in their tiny hand. Overseeing the babe is a Shrike (bird) who has impaled several mice and fish upon the thorns.",
      "It is a statue of a famous merchant prince from long ago. The eyes of the statue are embedded with precious gems.",

      "It is the statue of a king in armor that gives its back to the viewer–head bowed and hands over the face. Inscribed on the pedestal in Elvish is 'shame'.",
      "A giant apple, carved of stone and painted bright red, marks the entrance to a local orchard. It is a cherished landmark hailed by locals as The World's Biggest Apple. Somehow, you doubt that even this is true.",
      "It is a statue of a god who turns into an eagle. The statue depicts him as a humanoid with eagle wings instead of arms and a beak instead of a nose and mouth.",
      "A pregnant woman in a sharp iron crown, with three arms, three legs, and three separate anguished faces looking in different directions is tearing her breast and giving violent birth at the same time. One face is devouring the newborn.",
      "It’s a statue depicting a wyvern and a soldier, the wyvern lays on its back writhing in pain while the soldier stands on top of the wyvern and is pushing his spear through the creature’s chest using all his strength and bodyweight to pierce the thick skin of the wyvern.",
      "Two devilish imps in a tug of war with two cherubs on each of the shoulders of a great mage with floppy hair. The literal, metaphorical thread of thought that each side is trying to influence runs between the mage's ears. A great deal of effort has been put in to get the hat just right.",
      "A delicate statue of a bird, about to take flight. It looks to be made out of crystal clear glass, but will not break. A few rocks lie by it, as if thrown at it.",
      "A bronze statue of a huge serpent coils itself around a freestanding marble column. It gazes upwards, its eyes set with glittering emeralds. Atop the column is a lit brazier of magefire.",
      "It is a statue of a rugged miner swinging their pickaxe. A plaque at the bottom reads 'Couldn't have made this without you'.",
      "A great warrior-king caught in mid-disintegration; fully half of a Rune of Power etched into his enraged face, a portion of the actual physical manifestations of the magical runes left from the casting are captured, somehow, in the work. An enterprising mage might learn a few forbidden things or two from this masterwork.",
      "It is a statue of two figures facing each other with a rectangular frame in-between. The figures heavily resemble each other, but one is a human, while the other is a demon.",
      "An elegant deity-queen in fine marble, clothed only in flowing, sheer, diaphanous silk, with so many lifelike folds it appears as if the stone itself were really fabric. One hand and arm is raised in the act of casting a spell, the second hand and arm are lowered, and both legs appear to be performing a dance. The face is a featureless smooth, shallow bowl shaped depression.",
      "It is a statue of the ouroboros, the mythical snake that eats its own tail as a symbol of eternity.",
      "It is a statue of a predatory animal in a sitting position. You feel as if it's watching you.",
      "A holy warrior impaling a lich on an intricate and intimidating looking holy lance. The lance is broken.",
      "It is a statue of an old king sitting on his throne, with a spear in his hand.",
      "It is a statue of a valiant knight in full plate. The knight is holding his shield, which is decorated with a specific coat of arms, in front of him.",
      "A crystalline statue of a fabled master assassin in repose, lying in the throne of a king who was supposedly killed by them. The statue is plainly visible when seen straight-on, but becomes completely invisible when viewed from more than a 30deg angle. The Crystal of the statue is completely mundane, only worked by what must have been an absolute master craftsman.",
      "A gigantic stone head that was shorn off a larger-than-life statue, taken as plunder by the king's grandfather in a war of conquest in a far-off land.",
      "An abstract form resembling two large vertical cones touching point to point, with a crystal sphere at least 1 foot across impaled upon it. The sphere has an array of 26 finger sized holes radially spaced around the equator. The bottom cone has a finger-sized spiral groove with 13 rotations up its entire length.",
      "It is a statue of two lovers embracing. With their poses and the statue's position, you can barely see the lovers' faces.",
      "A condemned person moments before being drawn and quartered. The condemned is crying out. The statue is incredibly detailed, and even features gruesome whip scars on their back.",
      "A series of life-size, interlocked and entangled humanoid forms in forced perspective. The forms are all abusing, attacking, or fighting each other, some attempting to tear or devour limbs, others with various weapons. All appear distraught or afraid. The most 'distant' and smallest forms are being actively devoured by the 'closest' and largest.",
      "A young, well-to-do woman, a strapping soldier, and a little pet dog. The woman is dead, dying, or on a sick-bed. The woman and soldier are done in an abstract style, while the dog is lavished in life-like detail. The arms-man has committed suicide by stabbing themselves in the chest with a sword. An empty scabbard lies on the ground, strap pulled by the dog.",
      "Two statues of saints adorn either flank of a staircase. On the left, a dwarf holding a shortsword and an abacus; on the right, a human holding a basket of bread. They are dressed in robes and gaze sideways at one another. You feel a sense of calm as you pass between them.",
      "A statue of a dire wolf with its head arched back in a pitch dark room. It howls when any light is produced in the room.",
      "A holy feast, filled with fine food and drink, and a fine table, captured in utmost perfect detail. Beneath the table is a drunken minstrel attempting to steal some of the wine. A cherubim actively seeks to dissuade the drunkard wrapping their face with a cloudlike veil, while a devil actively prods the exposed buttocks of the drunkard with a fork.",
      "An archer god with winged feet and seven eyes riding a crescent moon. Their arrows and bow are extremely long.",
      "A life sized statue of a wizard holding a workable lamp. Lighting the lamp with magical fire causes the statue to rotate and shine the light on a nearby wall, revealing a secret door.",
      "A small fishing boat and crew, navigating through seemingly perilous waters. The statue is about half life-size in scale.",
      "An abstract form sits on a windy hilltop in a park: three long, curved tubes, cast of polished bronze and interwoven intricately. Each catches the wind and plays a low, whistling note, which combines in a sweetly melodious chord.",
      "It is a statue of a famous monster slayer from ages past. Stories of their deeds have traveled far and wide.",
      "It is a statue of a noble atop a horse, dressed as if they are getting ready for a pageant.",
      "A statue dedicated to The Pyromancer, an ancient adventurer with a penchant for fireballs. The statue of black stone, depicting a dragonborn in sorcerer robes, hands reaching forward as if mid-spell. The statue will very occasionally and without warning spout flames from its outstretched hands",
      "The statue of a dwarven folk hero stands before you, raising a mighty warhammer to the sky. If the top of the warhammer is pressed down, it opens a secret door in this room.",
      "A minecart full of ore and mining equipment, and a small, tired, mine-donkey.",
      "It is a large, slightly tilted slab of stone, onto which water drips down from an unknown source above. A small groove has formed around the droplets' path. A plaque at the bottom reads 'Monument to Persistence'.",
      "It is a statue of a dwarf kneeling, deep in prayer. His hands are clasped together and his eyes are tightly shut.",
      "It is a statue dedicated to a long-forgotten god of Thievery. No one has laid eyes on this statue for centuries.",
      "A caricature of an obscure harvest deity with a circular calendar carved over their smiling visage and hands cupped as if expecting an offering. The calendar is articulated to spin. The statue includes carved stalks of what appear to be flax.",
      "It is a statue of a king atop his favored horse. The king looks as if he is readying himself for battle.",
      "The statue of an elf king sits before you in a stone throne, its entirety wrapped in long, crawling ivy. If the ivy is cleared away, it grows back within 24 hours.",
      "It is a statue of a very important religious figure that died when they were very young. The good that they did for the world will never be forgotten.",
      "A two part statue comprising the large body of a pirate-king bravo, 3x life-size, carved from a lemony-green variegated alabaster with onyx, combined with a contrasting pink variegated alabaster with calcite throne behind. The king is seated, one hand in a metal gauntlet (made of carved stone) resting on an armrest, the other is holding a stone sword as if leading a charge. The king's nose is visibly replaced by an actual pewter prosthetic. The throne has been defaced, but in such a way as to have clearly been carved that way originally. The king's clothing and notably oversized hat, is a distinctive style of fine fashion among the sea-going swashbucklers, from a period of time roughly 100 years ago.",

      "The dragon lives near the ocean and collects interesting seashells.",
      "The dragon hoards people and does not intend to let you leave.",
      "The lair is a perfectly arranged art gallery, with exhibits rotating in and out of storage.",
      "The lair is a collection of fine fabrics, silks, and cloth, neatly bolted and displayed.",
      "The lair is a terrarium for a variety of small, local and exotic, fauna.",
      "The lair is a greenhouse for local and exotic flora.",
      "A coastal dragon keeps a sharp eye on ports and shipyards, looking for ships and other vessels that are up for sale, or due to be decommissioned. The dragon only collects treasure so that they may buy the ships themself, to add to their fleet.",
      "The dragon hoards skulls that it finds visually are texturally interesting.",
      "A massive collection of different types of poisons and potions, even some alchemists who are told to make new and more innovate concoctions or die trying.",
      "The dragon's lair contains a massive amount of unique weapons, from tiny pixie daggers to ballista designed to fell giants and everything in between.",
      "A litany of different types of rocks from various different regions.",
      "A hatchery of eggs from many different species including other types of dragons, hoarded by a dragon mother suffering from empty nest syndrome.",
      "Several animals thought to be extinct preserved in magical stasis. If the subject is brought up, the dragon will happily rant about the ones they drove to 1 over extinction themselves.",
      "Objects of cultural or religious significance. Though most aren't valuable or of any use in their own right, they each have an important place in history, such as the mysterious glowing boulder that the now large city of Brightstone sprung up around. Unsurprisingly the dragon has made quite a few enemies in their gathering of these relics.",
      "The skeletal heads of other dragons along with the most prized part of each of those dragons hoards. They intend to be the most prized part of their own hoard, and have set things up to become a ghost or similar after their own death so that they can enjoy and defend their completed hoard.",
      "Swords, arrows, cannons, and every other weapon or piece of ammunition that has been used against them. They seem to be fond of picking fights with powerful adventurers and well-armed military groups for the sole purpose of collecting scars and the weapons that left them.",
      "Particularly tall things - a large male giraffe, an unusually tall sunflower, etc.",
      "Weird spellbooks. Not the great tomes of forgotten archives but unique or weird spells like Melfs Minute Toaster or hydrafication (as horrible as it sounds). This dragon has some mundane problem and is looking for a spell to solve it.",
      "Fake gold. False gold, gold painted copper carefully weighed to match the real thing, etc. This dragon is a prankster and a dick with multiple 'hoards' they let thieves plunder while they act the part of a vengeful beast.",
      "A hoarder's hoard. There is gold and gems in the lair somewhere, but also tons of scrap, trash and bones. This hoarder dragon never throws away a single item.",
      "Wine and alcohols. The dragon never drinks itself, it hoards the alcohol for a party it plans to hold one day (which never actually comes).",
      "Trinkets that represent the heartbreaks of mortals. It collects those things that make us sad - letters from past lovers, mementoes of loved ones passed on, remnants of broken dreams, glories of civilizations long gone.",
      "Collections of poetry it has etched into its scales across its enormous body. It’s tail and wings grow whenever it runs out of space to accommodate new poems.",
      "Cute things. Stuffed animals, living and cute animals, babies snatched from parents, etc. Somewhere in its lair is a heap of discarded items, animals and people who no longer were cute enough to stay in the hoard.",
      "The dragon is obsessed with the things that people copy, and traces them back to their source. It collects the originals, which range from handwritten manuscripts of popular books, to the first prototypes of widely-used inventions, to outfits that set lasting trends.",
      "Things that have been sold for far more or far less than they were worth. Counterfeits made by con artists, magic items pawned without knowing their powers, an item that was fiercely contested in the auction hall, and a family heirloom sold out of desperation to pay off gambling debts and the currency of a kingdom whose overzealous coin minting lead to hyperinflation are among the collection. The dragon frequently philosophizes about the concept of monetary value.",
      "The skulls of as many unique kinds of creature as the dragon can find - it always discards duplicates. If you are of a particularly uncommon race, the dragon may not have a skull from your species yet, and it will want yours.",
      "The dragon attempts to steal things that someone treasures enough to come to the lair to get them back, where they will invariably be killed, their body displayed in the lair alongside the item. If they don't come, or if they send someone else, the dragon will destroy the item in view of the owner. The dragon doesn't care about destroying its hoard this way - any item that people don't face certain death for is not valuable enough.",
      "Taxidermy dragons, which the dragon kidnaps taxidermists to work on. They serve the additional function of decoys for attackers, as they are all in sleeping positions.",
      "Lawn ornaments - lawn gnomes, garden orbs, cat statues, windchimes, decorative rocks, etc.",
      "Feathers, Butterflies, and Beetles. Meticulously catalogued and displayed, then transmuted into precious materials, yet strangely still retaining much of their natural colors.",
      "The lair is filled with all sorts of games. The floor is covered in decks of ornate cards, crystal chess sets, and dice made from exotic woods and gemstones. The dragon is very intelligent and a great strategist and is looking for a combatant to challenge him in a battle of wits. So far, they are completely undefeated.",
      "Militaria- armor, uniforms, arms, only taking care for exceptional examples or complete and accurate uniforms- the PCs' hodgepodge of gear spurs no interest.",
      "The earliest known creations of renowned artists and crafters, which are often of poor quality compared to the later works that made them well known and are therefore rarer. The dragon will discard any item from its hoard as soon as it learns that an earlier example of workmanship from its creator exists.",
      "Religious symbols, some of which belong to religions long gone.",
      "Things the dragon considered 'perfect' for one reason or another. A perfectly round marble, a perfectly cut and unblemished gemstone, a clockwork mechanism of a genius design that can't possibly be improved, and so on.",
      "Jars filled with different kinds of sand from all over the region.",
      "Alloys. As many different metals as possible as pure as possible. A small bit of every type of steel imaginable, stored right next to the various kinds of brass.",
      "Crowns, taken from both grand kings of old and modern warlords, as long as its a crown of some kind it wants it.",
      "Music, it has piles of instruments and captured musicians, music can be herd throughout its lair. If records, wax cylinders, or some other object that can play music exists then it will also have lots of those.",
      "Princesses, as the dragon is lonely but views themself as too noble to take a commoner and well a princess is a traditional practice so it's socially acceptable.",
      "Beauty is mundane, but ugliness is interesting. This dragon's hoard is filled with mis-struck coins, gems with interesting flaws, and works of art/craftsmanship epitomizing the notion of 'awful taste, but great execution.' Its library contains the worst books and albums and films ever made. If benevolent, this dragon adopts and cares for ugly and malformed plants, animals, and even a few people. If malevolent, it kills such creatures, and preserves their bodies. A particularly evil and insane dragon might even physically (or magically) mutilate creatures to create such monstrosities itself.",
      "Blacksmith tools. The dragon forges equipment and he’s been at this for century. He’ll give you equipment if you give him raw materials.",
      "Orphans. The dragon collects the orphans of all the people he kills. The dragon treats them well, teaches them to read and write, but rarely actually sends them out into the world - out of fear for their safety or genuine greed, who's to say?",
      "Cursed artifacts. The dragon’s entirely collection consists of items like life-sucking swords, heart-ripping jade claws that make you kill people, and portraits that try to kill you. He’s a powerful enough sorcerer that none of this bothers him, but any would-be thieves usually fall victim to the hoard itself.",
      "Fossils. The dragon digs deep into the mountain and finds the bones of ancient dragons and other things.",
      "Drinking vessels. Glasses, horns , jugs , mugs etc. the dragon never uses them. He only drinks fresh spring water.",
      "Ideas - the dragon finds people with interesting ideas or rare knowledge and extracts that knowledge from the person, taking all memory of the knowledge away. Might be voluntary or involuntary.",
      "This dragon creates memorialized statues of all the heroes that have tried to stop him/her. Their lair is filled with stone statues of hundreds of brave adventurers.",
      "Unfinished paintings, from sketches on canvas to almost-done, plenty are wonderful to view, others poorly executed and confusing, but all were clearly left unfinished by the artists.",
      "Rugs, from simple rag rugs to finely handmade ones. Some may even be enchanted, but it's hard to say unless you're willing to go through the stacks and rolls of them.",
      "Candles, some bigger than a man, others small enough to be used as birthday candles. Used stubs to pristine sets. Scent-sensitive individuals take care, for the fumes from the unburnt scented candles can cause headaches!",
      "Trophies from mighty creatures the dragon has slain. You are too puny and weak to be worth hunting.",
      "The dragon's hoard is a giant fish tank full of goldfish. The dragon has named and loves every single one of them and gets unreasonably angry when they are not treated with respect.",
      "This dragon collects the crowns of kings and queens that he/she has toppled over the years.",
      "This dragon collects foundation bricks from castles, temples and palaces that now lay in ruins.",
      "This dragon collects miniature cities in jars that at first appear to be models, but turn out to be cities shrunken by magic.",
      "This dragon collects masks of different varieties. From masquerade masks, to cultural religious masks, to masks used in heists.",
      "Wood. Being fundamentally lizards, dragons can't generate their own body heat. But they can light a pile of firewood and bask around it to warm up on a cold night or morning.",
      "This dragon collects sand - one wall of the lair is lined with shelves containing jars of sand in every imaginable shade. The floor of the room is covered in a deep layer of sand, on which stand a maze of intricate sand sculptures.",
      "This dragon has dozens of collectible dolls that the dragon believes to be priceless artifacts but really they are only worth a couple of copper pieces each",
      "Bards. This dragon like music and is setting up their own festival. There are hundreds of kidnapped bards all in their own little rooms in the dragon's lair.",
      "This dragon collects secrets from everyone it meets. In order to interact with him, you have to give him a secret of your own.",
      "This dragon collects lich phylacteries. The dragon purposely seeks out liches, strikes a deal with them, and hides their phylactery in his lair.",
      "The dragon is an artist, arranging bones in new and creative, and often monstrous, skeletons adorned with jewels that have been soldered on using gold and other precious metals. Some skeletons even move; the dragon dabbles a bit in necromancy after all. So, be alert. Well, even more alert.",
      "Humanoid skeletons, divided by race, age, sex, nationality, some of them look incomplete.",
      "Defeats. A young dragon took the adage that one only grows in defeat too literally and acts as a recurring nuisance to adventuring parties. Whenever driven off, outwitted or even killed, they depart amicably and thank the party for a sterling lesson and vow they will not be so easy to defeat next time.",
      "Things from the future, like keyboards, plastic bottles, markers, superhero graphic novels.",
      "The pages of books or scrolls containing the death sentence of a criminal.",
      "Weapons used to execute famous criminals.",
      "Sport trophies, either stolen from the athletes or that the dragon won themself.",
      "Little dragon statues and toys from toy shops all across the realm.",
      "Tails, tooth and claws of different reptile creatures.",
      "Glasses and lenses All different shapes and sizes and strengths. They enjoy hanging them in sunlight.",
      "Sea Glass. They've arranged them in gradient piles.",
      "Flying machines, spell books/scrolls that allow flight, and dead flying creatures. Only dragons should be allowed to fly.",
      "An aquatic dragons hoard is filled with carriages and other means of land based travel, interesting sleds and bicycles, all things that they have been able to steal from the shore or from boats lost at sea.",
      "Sharps. Anything sharp and pointy. If it would hurt your feet to step on they have it. They have a caltrop corridor they take massive pride in.",
      "Faces. Much of the skin has leathered and tanned. They've used it as decoration but once they filled up the walls they've got to carpeting the floors with them too.",
      "Lucky Charms. Anything that has been used for luck whether truly lucky or just believed to be. Its full of socks, rabbits feet, horseshoes and clovers but occasionally there is a true lucky stone hidden among it all.",
      "Diaries. The books are arranged in age of the author, language and then alphabetically. Whilst most of benign or wholesome there are a few diaries written by serial killers detailing their evil deeds. On the other hand, some are written by adventurers as they took on some insurmountable task to save the world.",
      "Copper coins. Why have a gold hoard when a copper one would be 100 times as big! This way it looks much more impressive.",
      "An exceedingly gregarious Silver Dragon has a particular fondness for collecting Obligations. It is often willing to perform favors and deeds in exchange for a signed contract declaring that the receiver of the favor is now obligated to perform in-kind at the Silver Dragon's behest. Within its lair are magically-protected and meticulously organized archives filled with Obligations. Many of those who gave the Obligation are long since deceased.",
      "An Ancient Green Dragon long ago developed the hobby of plant grafting and tending. Its lair is filled with unique specimens that exist no where else in the world. Of particular pride is its collection of carefully and diligently crafted Blights. From Bonsai fruit tree Blights, to unique specimens of flower blights. Its vibrant Rose Blights' rosehips are rumored to have miraculous magical healing and curative properties.",
      "Keys. The dragon has assembled a massive pile of keys for all sorts of locks. It is willing to allow the key's owner to make a copy of it before it takes the original, but it only wants the originals. Keys that close important objects (castle gates, the door to a treasury, the chest holding a lich's phylactery) are especially prized. If you know what to look for, you could find a key to any door, chest, or other lock... but 'needle in a stack of needles' is being too generous.",
      "The dragon has made an alliance with a beholder. The beholder hunts down individuals the dragon names and zaps them with its disintegration ray, then uses telekinesis to load the dust left behind into a small bag. The dragon takes the bag and adds it to the veritable mountain of bags in its lair. In return, the beholder can keep any of the possessions of the deceased it may want.",
      "Mistakes. The dragon is obsessed with flawed and imperfect objects. A sword tempered too early, so brittle it would shatter if it hit something. A book with the pages printed in the wrong order. A statue with the nose missing due to clumsiness on the part of the sculptor. A glass bottle that bent as it was being blown.

      "This dragon has one of everything. As in, exactly one, of every conceivable type of thing he could get his hands on. No two items in the hoard are identical; he may have multiple swords, but the one saber is curved and single edged, the one longsword longer and straight, this particularly amusing one, the falx, has the concave part sharpened! He is fascinated by the differences in similar objects, hence one of each 'kind' of sword, one of each species of bean, one taxidermy cat of each coat color, et cetera.",
      "A tiny dragon that hoards objects with a high value per size; itty-bitty yet oh so flawless diamonds, drops of potent poisons in small glass ampoules, coins from lost ages precious to collectors, et cetera.",
      "This dragon hoards sentimental value. A childhood plushie, the antlers of the first seer someone killed, all items that have little monetary value compared to the sentimental value placed by the one who lost it. The dragon does not take the items away from them, though if this dragon were evil they might manipulate circumstance such that they would lose the item 'by themselves'.",
      "A hoard of stories. Fiction, non-fiction, or even fiction pretending to be non-fiction, this dragon holds a collection of stories he has been told in exchange for, perhaps, another story, or freedom. The only rule: 'It doesn't count if I've heard it before'. A calligraphy wyrm writes it all down on parchment as a volunteer helper, and it's for this reason the dragon seems to refuse stories about a dragon abducting cows.",
      "Garbage. This dragon is interested in what others consider insignificant and have thrown away. Broken and unneeded objects are displayed throughout the lair.",
      "Proof of every city and town it has snuck into in human form. Sometimes it is just the log book at an inn it stayed at, other times it is a notable landmark.",
      "This dragon collects puppets. You will find glove puppets mounted on severed hands and arms, sock puppets on severed legs and feet & marionette puppets posed hanging from hooks on the ceiling, all of varying sizes. The dragon uses a mix of magical and natural ventriloquism to bring his collection to life.",
      "Elements - This dragon is obsessed with keeping track of materials in their purest, elemental form, keeping piles of gold, silver, cobalt, tin, etc, and is on the verge of creating a crude periodic table.",

The clause of the curse was this: True love would never be found as long as the white sands fall down. The captain piloted the 'Cursed Heart' ship and when he died, became a sorrowful ghost. Somewhere on another ship, the nymph comes alive only for one hour a night on a full moon. The cursed heart will always attack the Sea Nymph in order to take the wooden figurehead. The sorceress (jilted fiance) guarded the never-ending hourglass at the top of her tower. When she died, she became a Banshee guarding the last thing she loved... the curse.",

      "The town guards are intentionally allowing crime to run rampant in certain areas which is giving the King a bad reputation. Is this a matter of principle to protest a refused pay raise?

The gathered crowd is awestruck as a brilliant light descended on his body, exploding in a harmless but temporarily blinding flash, and the body was gone. Even more mysteriously, now a handful of citizens have an invisible mark on their right cheek that glows whenever they near or enter the temple/holy site where it happened.

The kelp-freits try to set up flanks between themselves, so they can combine their scissors to gruesome amputative effect.",
      "A drunken giant building an equally giant sandcastle. It’s dangerously oblivious in its scooping and molding, and if pestered will demand you act out its imaginings of what life in a castle is like with the frightened prisoners the giant’s already captured.",
      "A big, stoic sandstone face carved into the side of a hill. It will open its mouth to the treasure stashed within only for the person it was carved to resemble. The enchantment on it is rather crude, so a mask painted to look like it, its reflection in a mirror, and the like would all be sufficient to fool the face into opening. Dynamite will also open the face, but risks damaging the treasure within.",
      "A discarded coffer full of cursed silver coins. If carried they’ll tarnish any other precious metals you touch, and will return to your possession the night after you spend them. They’ll appear in your mouth if you’ve got no bags or pockets for them.",
      "A group of young nobles play polo as their bodyguards watch on. They’re growing bored with their game and eager for new amusements. They nobles unfamiliar with the possibility of their actions having negative consequences. Together their horses and jewelry are worth a small fortune to a discreet buyer who wouldn’t sell you out to the nobles’ parents.",
      "A decrepit yacht drifting down the shore. Its undead passengers believe themselves to still be alive and at an upscale party, dancing and drinking from dusty glasses. They’ll get violent if anything disturbs this illusion, and start off assuming any unfamiliar faces are servants. Some durable valuables are still onboard.",
      "A storm tears through the area, coming and going in maelstromous moments. Soon after the storm passes, a party of fairies riding albatrosses swoop down and ask which direction their quarry went. If told honestly you’ll wake up some days later with a bottle of lightning by your head. If they’re lied to you’ll find yourself caught in a deluge every time you try to sleep outside for the next month.",
      "A spattering of holes and the goblins digging them. They’ve got a waterlogged treasure map, the ink too smudged to read clearly, and are digging all over the approximate area of where “X” marked the spot.",
      "A collection of jars, some shattered, some whole, all caught in some muck. Within them is some goo. Drinking the goo inflicts a piscine mutation: gills, bulging eyes, legs fused into fins, skin turned to scales, and so on. Each jar’s goo inflicts a single mutation.",
      "An estuary where crocodiles lurk.",
      "A basket bobbing in the sea foam. Within is a wailing baby, several items of golden jewelry, and a note. The note explains that the baby is the youngest son of a king, sent downriver to escape the murderous attention of the crown prince. It further implores its reader to raise the baby well, take the jewelry as payment (though leaving one piece as a keepsake), and some day tell them of their royal heritage and duty to overthrow their tyrannous sibling.",
      "An impromptu bazaar halfway in the water. Merchants from land and sea have gathered here to trade goods only found in their respective environs.",
      "A holy oil spill shimmering on top of the water. It’ll still be potent if bottled. In the center of the spill a ghoul shivers atop a raft and cries for help.",
      "A crate of wax-sealed amphora full of wine that’s soured to vinegar. One of the amphora, painted with sharks instead of dolphins, is packed with cocaine or something similar.",
      "The way down the beach here is craggy, with rough waters slamming rougher rocks hemming in one side and a sheer cliff the other. The crags ahead are home to giant barnacles, glued in place but able to lash out at intruders with their tremendous penises.",
      "Some fishermen gambling around a barbecue pit.",
      "The sand here is full of sharp shards of rock and glass, cutting feet like caltrops if walked on. Goblins on stilts with bows and pikes are patrolling the area.",
      "Coral mounds dot this place and strange fish swim through the air. This is the ghost of an ancient reef now on land by the long movement of geology, lost in the memory of life. The ghostly animals behave as they would while alive, including attacking when hungry or provoked.",
      "Someone’s drowning, caught in a riptide. If rescued they’ll be grateful, but don’t have much to offer besides their service.",
      "A friendly horse trots up the beach to you. It’s a kelpie in disguise. If touched you’ll stick to it and it’ll gallop into the water.",
      "A floating dock that trails out to a prime fishing spot.",
      "A fresh shipwreck. There’s a three-way argument between some human scavengers, goblins, and fish-men as to how to split the spoils. They haven’t come to blows yet, but they’re close.",
      "A desiccated ocean chimera (eel for a tail, heads from a turtle, a pufferfish, and a seahorse, body like all four mashed together, breathes gouts of inky venom) placed above the high tide line. Contact with water will restore it instantly to lively hostility.",
      "A dire cormorant snacking on a splatter of dead fish washed ashore by a swell. Protective of its food but otherwise placid. Tameable.",
      "A party of adventurers like yourself, all naked and quite deranged from sun exposure and drinking seawater. If kept calm will tell confusing fragments of how they arrived at their current state.",
      "Colourful, frilly seaslug-men crowd around you and probe with soft appendages, babbling all the while. They’re tourists from the undersea realms. Curious about you, but unable to speak your language, and assume their gesticulations are more comprehensible than they are. At the first sign of violence they’ll vomit their guts out and crawl over each other to get back in the ocean.",
      "A sea stack engraved with abstract images. On moonless nights a coven of witches convenes to dance atop it with an octopoid demon, the master they’re sworn to.",
      "A salt evaporation pond. People from a nearby village sing work songs as they dredge the salt.",
      "An abandoned, algae-encrusted net. Entangled in it is a fish-bitten revenant on a quest to avenge its own murder, stymied by the fact that its hands and tongue have been eaten off.",
      "Gems ground to dust have been mixed into the sand here, glittering in ruby and sapphire hues. It’d be valuable but time consuming to sift it out here, but this risks attracting the attention of wandering monsters. The mixed sand could be packed up to be sifted elsewhere, but the ratio of sand-to-gem-dust could make it prohibitively heavy.",
      "A lifelike, gently smiling statue carved from salt, up to its knees in the sand. Those within the statue’s field of view (if its eyes could see) receive a penalty to their ability to resist outside influences on their mind.",
      "A fishing ogre with waves lapping at its shins. The ogre is currently distracted wrestling with a shark that’s bitten its line.",
      "A lightly sleeping lion-naga basking on the sun-warmed sand.",
      "Something golden glints in shallow water. It’s treasure, being used as a lure by fish-men. They’ll attack if you blunder into their environment.",
      "A lone mermaid, swimming down the beach from the opposite direction as you. Gives a wave, then goes on her way.",
      "The sea foam’s piled ashore here over your head, and widely enough that you can’t easily walk around it. Easy enough to push through it, but you can’t see in it past your nose. Something’s hiding in the foam, waiting for prey to wander in.",
      "A shrine to a maritime deity, shells and ribbons laid at its idol’s feet. A tired, old, snappy priestess and her bored apprentice live in a shack nearby and maintain the shrine.",
      "Goblins training gulls to shit in peoples’ eyes.",
      "A red tide laps at the shore. It’s infested with vampiric, symbiotic algae. A gaggle of infested people (evident by their crimson eyes and veins) are bathing in the stuff. They try to ply you with drugs and good company to offer up some blood (any sort will do), and become increasingly agitated if you do not. Their preferred mode of attack is to spike the dose of whatever they can get you to take with a sedative and drain you while you’re passed out.",
      "A sea turtle nesting site. You’ve arrived at just the right time to see the mass hatching. Predators will be gathering soon to pick off the baby turtles before they reach the water. Maybe you’ll be joining them.",
      "A sudden fog rolls in. Vague lights can be seen through it. Lanterns? Will-o’-wisps? Lures? Perhaps it’s better to avoid them than investigate.",
      "A burial at sea. Mourners place treasures on the boat of their chief, then set it ablaze. It’ll sink some distance out. Polite observers will be invited to join the festivities to follow.",
      "An execution. The offender is being buried up to their head below the high tide line. Someone in the gathered crowd is being held back, screaming that the one being buried has been falsely charged. By law they’ve got until the tide comes in to prove it.",
      "A retreat of mystics contemplating the mysteries of the ocean.",
      "The tower of a heretical astrologer attempting to capture the moon and stars in their reflection off the water.",
      "A floating hull overcome with lead-grey fungus, its crew dead by a saprophytic plague they picked up on distant shores. Some immature sprouting stalks already release thin streams of spores. If not burned or otherwise disposed of the hulk might fully fruit and infest the whole region.",
      "The sand here is spongy, grey, mercury-infused. The fumes rising off it can induce delusions. Some goblins who think themselves human are already here huffing the stuff.",
      "A tide pool with a sheepishly dying merman stuck in it. Needs some convincing that surviving is worth the embarrassment of his situation, but will vouch for you to other his underwater allies if rescued.",
      "A nuckalavee charges from the surf. A tireless pursuer, but can’t cross freshwater.",
      "A resplendent coconut palm held sacred by local people. They know, but don’t speak openly of, a ritual by which you can remove an evil presence from someone’s mind (possession, madness, domination, enchantment, etc.) by trepanning them, drilling to the core of a coconut from the sacred palm, and placing the holes together to draw the evil presence from their head and into the coconut. Trees grown from coconuts used in the ritual are twisted things, bearing the mark of the evil they contained.",
      "A group clad in immaculate white robes, browbeating some reluctant few members into following them willingly into the ocean. Apparently a suicide cult. Non-members are proselytized to, and asked not to interfere.",
      "A dwindling iceberg-fortress run aground too far south by unfavourable currents. Its garrison of snow elves are paranoid towards outsiders but desperate for direction to a colder place. It’s a toss-up as to which sentiment will win out.",
      "A self-crewed golem-ship in need of a captain. Willing to kidnap someone to serve the role.",
      "The secret dockyards of a nearby nation, where they’re developing experimental ships. Its guards will be aware of your perimeter breach (though not your exact position) and on high alert.",
      "A fisher-monk stands posed upon a rock in impossible stillness, wielding a barbed harpoon. He waits for the vanishingly rare rainbow-urchin to pass by, a creature with spines of light of every hue and shade. When he spots it he’ll strike with unerring precision. If interrupted before then the monk will be incomprehensibly salty.",
      "Sargasso spreads before you, from the beach to the distant horizon. Everything you’ve ever lost beckons from its green tangles. This is a portal to the Sargassium, a world where all things can be found again, or where you too might be lost forever.",
      "The water withdraws, the horizon swells. A tidal wave is coming.",
      "A fish-man flags you down, says they were supposed to meet with a representative from a nearby village to discuss trade agreements, tribute, and breeding rights. As that representative is late, the fish-man explains, you will have to do. Some time in to the negotiation (or fighting, or whatever else) the representative will arrive and react to you based on how you’ve argued for the village’s interests.",
      "You glimpse a howling whirlpool and waltzing waterspouts a long way from the shore. The visible surface signs of the weapons of an underwater war.",
      "While walking along on the sand, you suddenly look down and see a turtle crawling toward you. You reach down and flip it over onto its back. The turtle lies there, its belly baking in the hot sun, beating its flippers, trying to turn itself over, but it cannot do so without your help. You are not helping. Why?",

      "When your players awake in the morning after a restless night of camping, they discover footprints all around them in the dirt. Their backpacks have been looked through, but nothing has been stolen. This happens a few more nights in a row.",
      "Someone notices eyes glittering in the dark at them. Anyone with darkvision can make out an unidentifiable shape. When light is shone towards them there is nothing there.",
      "You find a corpse with it’s eyes and mouth filled with dirt, still grasping the axe that’s embedded in the nearest tree.",
      "You find a massive circle of felled trees, in the center of which is a malnourished and wild-eyed greataxe wielding orc, yelling about fending off an endless hoard of regrowing enemies.",
      "A deep fog rolls in faster and thicker than one would think is natural. All rolls related to navigation or investigation based on the terrain have disadvantage.",
      "The party is set upon by a group of bandits, ferociously attacking them with abandon. Suspiciously, they do not yell or even speak. DC 10 to notice their mouths have been sewn shut and their eyes look wild with panic, as if their actions are not their own.",
      "A lone child that refuses to talk but will hold one of the adventures hands, and theirs alone (normally while sucking her thumb). If the child feels threatened, she will run away from the party and they won’t be able to find her again. There are no tracks. (Optional: If they look after her for a night, she will leave them a gift.)",
      "A dog with a fancy collar appears to lead the party to an area of disturbed dirt and begins to dig it up. Upon closer inspection the party finds the body of a small girl holding a leash that looks quiet similar to the dogs collar. When they turn to examine the dog, he is nowhere to be found.",
      "Cats appear to be watching the party from the trees. Dozens upon dozens of them. Whenever a member of the party approaches them they run away and can’t be found (may serve as lookouts for a darker force).",
      "While camped for the night, the party’s extinguished campfire relights to a full blaze. The second the party member on watch looks at the fire, it extinguishes completely. The only sign that the mysterious fire ever existed is a faint smell of burning twigs.",
      "Deep in the forest, approaching dusk, the party finds a logging camp. Several small cabins and a mill. Smoke curls lazily up from one or two of the chimneys. There is nobody in the camp. There are plates of food on tables, still warm. Clothes on a washing line are still damp. Only the doors into the mill are locked. As night falls, a fierce storm begins to build, and from the mill the saws can be heard rasping back and forth, though they don’t sound quite right…",
      "The party finds a scraggly, disheveled child apparently lost in the forest. It asks the party for help, should the party agree, they come under the effects of a curse until they defeat the child (Actually a restless Evil) who flees, attempting to lead them into a hazard deeper in the forest.",
      "Small dolls sit in a tree the players pass by. They are wearing crude clothes, and don sticks of specific lengths. Poor perception rolls feel anonymous sets of eyes gazing at you, while good perception rolls can discover them. These dolls, if ignored, will appear again in a different tree a few feet up, requiring lower rolls as they subtly make themselves more obvious. Upon the first investigation, you find that the dolls are poorly stitched together, with leaves still poking out of the burlap fabric, and expressionless faces with small stones as eyes. However, with each successive perception roll as the party walks away, the dolls become slightly more realistic. On additional rolls their rock-eyes appear to follow you (Mona Lisa style), their skin becomes taut and leathery, and their clothes become more realistic. Repeat as necessary, with the players unable to leave a small section of the forest (due to magical barriers, or because walking straight forward keeps leading them back to the same spots.) Eventually, all of the dolls should clearly resemble everyone in the party. It is important that the dolls never appear to move on their own, and in every way act as though an inanimate object would. They can be destroyed, ripped, held, carried, etc. There should also be at least 4 separate perception checks on the dolls IMO. It really draws the frustration out, and that is an expression of fear. The final perception check on the dolls will have the dolls be very hard to find, except by one person, who you can choose beforehand. No matter how well other party members roll, the person you choose will feel a tingling on the back of their neck, and turn around to find the dolls in a high branch. They are nearly perfect mimics of the party, and are standing around the doll that looks like the person who discovered them, whose doll has a thick piece of string around their neck. The person feels paralyzed as the can only just watch due to fear, as time slows around them. The doll-party gazes directly into the player characters real eyes, and gently… pushes. For extra effect, have a pencil ready to snap upon this moment. Sometimes the cheesy sound effect speaks volumes more than words. The party will usually react at this point, let them destroy the dolls. It’s cathartic. If you want to continue the fear though, every one in a while later on, let them see a flicker of movement out of the corner of their eyes. Bonus points if you pick a grunge or mistake to build this off of. Like if a cleric forgets to heal a fighter and the fighter calls, have one of them be the one that pushes the other off, as though the cleric purposely didn’t heal, or the fighter was trying to get revenge. If the party has a rogue, have their doll slip a stick in the back of the hanged on. There’s a ton of customization you can do, and if done well, you can seed a lot of discord between two player characters and build their relationship to be really dynamic. Happy Creepy Crawlies.",
      "After spending more and more time in the forest, the players start to notice the trees have grown faces. It’s unknown if this is just them going crazy, or if it’s real.",
      "As the party sets down for camp they hear a muttering in the shrubs and then creeping out from it they behold a Gibbering Mouther, each eye and mouth seemingly drawn from a different creature, without repetition. Just before their skin and brains begin to itch, each party member realizes they do not recognize any of their kind yet among its monstrous morphology…",
      "As the night lengthens, from the shadows surrounding the campfire, come the light chiming sounds of children’s laughter. The laughter gets louder as the flames fall to coals.",
      "The wood you gathered for the night is not enough to keep the flames high all night and the sounds are deeper from the dark woods.",
      "A sweet glade, dappled with sunlight and shadows provide a relief from the previous heat and humidity. A gentle brook flows along one edge and gurgled merrily. Several fruit trees sit in the center and lay heavily with ripe fruits. Flowers fragrant the air and a gentle breeze cool the glen, sweetening the air and cooling the weary traveler. An old body hangs from a limb of the tree, but upon inspection it appears obvious they could have stood and not strangled.",
      "You come across an alter, freshly used and dripping with blood. Meat has been portioned and set out for something.",
      "An open clearing shows the remains of several bodies arranged in a glyph like patter. Due to dismemberment and missing pieces you are not sure how many bodies were used. As you review the scene, the trail behind you vanishes and leaves naught but deep and ancient thorn bushes, redolent with the faint reek of decaying flesh.",
      "A medium sized hut made of gingerbread and various pieces of candy. A kindly old woman asks you in for dinner.",
      "A pile of shit with human clothes, hair and bones in.",
      "The party find a clearing with an odd nature alter in the center. While they are distracted, the trees around them move closer. If they are distracted for long enough, the trees form a complete wall. The trees do not attack; they only defend themselves if attacked.",
      "There is a tree with deep scratches in it, as if it has been attacked by a dagger. Upon inspection, the player discovers old, dried blood embedded in the bark and writing in a deep red color that says ‘Find me, help me’ (illusory script). As the party continues they see more trees of a similar nature, and eventually find a crazed gnome who is determined to eat party members in order to restore his youth.",
      "The path opens into a clearing. Near the center is a unicorn lying down on its side. It looks serene and peaceful. The clearing is bright and quiet. Almost silent but for distant birdsong. If the party approach they realize it is dying. Its throat is torn open by some powerful beast and the wound looks infected or poisoned. The edges of the clearing are creeping in, going brown or fungus laden and choked with weeds and branches, which seem to close in whenever no one is looking in that direction. The unicorn is probably (?) past any help the party can give but may last an hour. Left to its own devices, the clearing will close in maybe 20 minutes.",
      "The trees appear to be leaning closer together and are a different shade of green to normal trees. As a breeze blows they seem to be whispering to each other wisha…wisha…wisha",
      "The undergrowth is thick confining you to a narrow path. It switched sharply left then right…. to a dead end. Turning back it is a dead end that way. The only way forward is to hack through the lower branches and scrub. As the players do, the cut stems ooze blood. If burned instead the wet plants hiss and whistle as they burn sounding like tortured screams.",
      "You begin to notice that everything looks familiar. Slowly it dawns on you that the trees are all identical, right down to that twig that snapped off when it caught on you backpack.",
      "A family of forest giants has caught the scent of the party while hunting. They’re catching up.",
      "Disembodied screams echo around you. Ghosts of the past? Or maybe it’s Jim the halfling rogue, trying to scare off tourists so he can start a coalmine?",
      "In the distance you see a light. When you get closer you see a lamp hanging from a tree swinging in the wind. It is full of oil but there are no signs of whoever put the lamp there.",
      "You find humanoid skeletons tied together to form the rough shape of a horse. If you use speak with dead on it, it only screams.",
      "You suddenly realize that all the noise in the forest is gone. As if silence had been cast but you can still talk and make noise as normal. Suddenly the forest is filled with howls, screeches, and buzzing so loud it deafens the party. When the party can hear again the forest is back to normal.",
      "You come across a cottage in the woods belonging to a friendly woodsman and his wife. They provide food and shelter for the night. When the party awakes they are in the burned down ruins of a cottage with the skeletal remains of the farmer and his wife reaching desperately for the party.",
      "A hooded figure sits on a stump. He does not respond to anything. If you attack or touch the figure they collapse into a swarm of spiders.",
      "A parrot is found on a branch repeating the words ‘Gods what is that?!’",
      "The party finds a wanted poster tacked to a tree with a group shot of the party with a red X marked through two of the party members faces. The party does not remember posing for this picture nor know why they would be wanted.",
      "You come upon a dry riverbed. From the trees lining the banks dangle a hundred mutilated corpses.",
      "Two children play fight with sticks, laughing and taunting each other. When they notice the party watching, they’ll happily put on a show. That’s when the other children emerge from the trees, only they aren’t playing and they’ve got more than just sticks and stones.",
      "A strangely inviting cave comes in to view. Surely it’s some kind of den and we shouldn’t go in but I just… cant…. help it.",
      "From deep within the forest loud clicking and chattering noises of various pitches and tempo can be heard. Upon inspection a small city raiding party dressed in armor have been brutally mutilated with heads twisted round and limbs ripped off. The same clicking noise starts again and gets closer and louder. When it seems like the creature is on top of them it suddenly stops and does not reappear.",
      "It has been at least 24 hours since sunset and it has yet to come back up. What’s worse is that all the forest chatter from insects and wildlife has trickled nearly to a standstill save for one slow but consistent crunching that has been following at a distance for hours now. Are the stars even moving anymore?",
      "Early in the day the party passes underneath a suit of armor suspended in the trees, branches occupying the inside of the suit as if they had squeezed out the body that occupied it before. Branches sprout from the facemask wildly, limbs protrude from the leg and armholes, and the entire chest piece is nearly bursting from the volume of foliage it contains.",
      "Just when its time to make camp for the night yet again within the damp cold forest, the party comes across an old house sitting unoccupied in a small clearing. They seek comfort in the house, building a fire in the hearth and drinking some old booze left by previous tenants. Keeping good watch, they peer out the windows frequently. Maybe it’s just the old wine but are the trees…. getting closer?",
      "A few chickens are pecking at the dirt in the middle of the trail. When you come upon them, you spook them, and they trot off into the forest a few meters. They resume pecking; but little does anyone know that they’ve begun to peck seeds that have the effect of the enlarge spell. Treat an enlarged chicken as an allosaurus and let the fun begin.",
      "Glowing eyes stare out of a knothole in an old and gnarled tree. When the players notice it watching, the thing scampers deeper into the tree. If they investigate the knothole they’ll find it goes deep, deeper than the tree itself. At the bottom of the hole something glitters. Gold? Many more glowing eyes stare up around it.",
      "A corpse sways in the branches of a lonely willow by a stream, dangling from a noose. The corpse is grinning, and dancing a slow, merry jig.",
      "Something howls in the distance. Another something responds. Not wolves. The howls are too ragged, sound too much like words.",
      "A little twig-and-twine doll is pinned to a branch up ahead. Another just like it can be seen just off the path, and another beyond that one. Even in the depths of the woods you’ll be protected so long as you follow them. Your safety once you arrive where they’re leading you is less guaranteed. A polite invitation has been extended. It won’t come again.",
      "Moaning can be heard from a bush. Within is a hunter, near-death, near incoherent from fear. No mere animal could have inflicted the wounds he bears. They’re too precise, suggestive of strange symbols.",
      "The trees in this part of the forest are all wrong. They’re growing in neat rows; they sway though there is no wind. Strange fruits swell in their boughs. You’ve stumbled into an orchard. Were those stones you stepped over a ways back someone’s fence?",
      "A boar bursts out of the undergrowth; foaming spittle flecks its tusks. It charges, eyes bloodshot, but makes no move to defend itself. All its attacks seem half-hearted. What drove this beast to seek death so?",
      "Cloying mist drifts into the region. You can barely see five paces ahead of you. Vague, bulbous forms can be seen protruding from the trees as you pass. Fungus. This isn’t mist, it’s spores.",
      "A fire shines through the trunks a little ways from you. Around it are adventurers, like you, camping for the night. None of them speak the same languages as you. The forest has them spooked, paranoid. They’ll welcome familiar company at first, but any number of things you do could set them off.",
      "A pond in a clearing, clean and still. No animal drinks from it, no insects buzz above it. No monsters will approach here beyond the tree line. Is it safe for you to stay here?",
      "The forest path is narrow and overgrown. Looking down the tunnel-like trail gives you vertigo and puts you off balance. Shadows appear to move and you feel like you’re just going in circles.",
      "The forest itself seems to be against your presence. Roots seem to spring up to trip you and branches swat at you when moved out of the way. The canopy closes around you shutting out the sunlight.",
      "The players hear footsteps echoing theirs, slightly behind, but the path is empty. Anything they call out is repeated back with missing syllables, as if the voice is in pain.",
      "A child’s laughter is heard off of the path, along with a flicker of light, which keeps appearing further away if the party follows. It leads them to the body of an elven boy with an arrow in his back.",
      "One member of the party hears the creaking of the trees and sounds of the forest suddenly stop, then a voice right behind them whispers their name on a hoarse voice, but there is no one there. None of the others notice anything different.",
      "The players hear the sounds of cries and screams from soldiers and the guttural cries of a nightmarish creature echo through the forest. The last one goes quiet before they reach them. If they choose to search, they find scattered around the ground the weather-worn skeletal remains of 16 soldiers from a long-dead empire known for it’s brutal methods, some of which are found ripped apart apparently trying to flee.",
      "The players feel as though something is watching them, but can’t see anything in the darkness. If they move more than 30ft in any direction they hear rustling following, but no matter how much they search cannot find anything.",
      "A dead character from one of the character’s past stands amongst the trees, with the appearance and wounds they had when they died. Only one person can see them. The character doesn’t move, but silently watches the player. Any attacks go through them without causing damage. They dissolve into a smoke-like darkness after 1d6 minutes.",
      "The sound of whispering is heard behind a bush. When it is pulled back or someone moves behind it, the whispering stops abruptly and a darkened feather falls slowly to the ground.",
      "A group of little girls are tied to the trees just off of the path, crying quietly. If the party goes to rescue them, they fight being rescued and attempt to escape and retie themselves to the trees, warning that ‘the Grogleman’ will come for them and their families too if they return home.",
      "A group of giants sit motionless around a giant chessboard, eyes intent on the pieces. Closer examination reveals the three are corpses; fungi grow from their eyelids and out of their hair, and the bodies slump and collapse if touched.",
      "The ground on both sides of the trail seems odd; upon closer examination, it is absolutely swarming with termites, covering the whole ground like a wave. If the party steps off the trail, the insects scatter from the party’s feet, leaving strange, momentary footprints in the ground.",
      "Prayers cannot be uttered aloud in the forest; spells can be cast as normal, but any verbal component comes out as a rattling hiss.",
      "A thick fog hovers over the ground, reaching up about two feet (to the chests of any halflings in the party, to the knees of humans). Anyone putting their heads in the fog (bending down to pick something up, etc.) hears muffled screams and far-off voices begging for their lives.",
      "Each person awakes to find a large meat hook carefully placed along on their bedrolls over their stomachs.",
      "In the periphery of the party’s vision, the trees that they pass seem to take on the image of a grim army, marching next to the party. When faced directly, the trees seem rather normal. The whole forest smells like a battlefield.",
      "Every time anyone lights a fire in the forest, there is a sudden hissing and smoking from the ground for twenty feet around the sparks. Little red lines appear like veins in the earth before fading to blackness.",
      "A monkey in a Jester’s costume comes swinging through the trees, hooting and screeching. If the adventurers catch the monkey, they find a bloody knife stuck in its belt. The monkey stares at them all with a baleful expression.",
      "Crows are screaming at each other as the party enters the woods. Increasingly, the screams sound like words, demanding blood.",
      "The hedge on the side of the trail has strange burn marks in it, almost exactly in the shape of men.",
      "A fox with a bloodied and broken leg comes limping up the path to the party and will pass by it if it can. If anyone speaks to it, the fox changes form into an old druidic woman, who mumbles about the forest being unsalvageable.",
      "As the party walks into the forest, they are greeted by an adventuring group coming the opposite direction. They chat for a little bit, explaining they found the woods too dangerous and are making their way back to whatever town the party has just come from. A little farther into the woods, the party finds the corpses of the same adventuring group, gathered around the sputtering embers of a fire…",
      "A bucket has been nailed to a tree, with a crude sign saying ‘Donations’ hanging under it. The bucket is half-filled with fingers and toes in varying levels of freshness.",
      "A small, neat signboard reads, ‘Please remain on the path.’ The neatness is somewhat marred by the corpses strewn below the sign.",
      "Someone has sharpened the branches around the trail in the forest, so that the trail is surrounded by sharp points.",
      "The party finds themselves staring at a strange tableaux- the corpse of a squirrel is placed next to an acorn, followed by (in order) the corpse of a cat, a dog, a wolf, and a bear. Behind the bear are strange scuffmarks in the dirt, like there was another corpse behind it, this one in the shape of something human…",
      "As the party walks through the forest, a strange figure suddenly drops from the trees in front of them- upon inspection, it is an effigy in the rough shape of a man, made of wooden boughs and leaves. This happens twice more as they walk. The fourth time, the figure drops down again, but anyone going to clear it away finds that it is actually the corpse of a man this time, with branches lashed to his limbs and a grisly smile on his face…",
      "A cold mist creeps into the surrounding area, players who breathe it will be asked to make a roll (perception, nature, etc.) but they’re making a constitution save with whatever modifier from the false roll. Anyone who rolls above a set DC inhales the mist and is subject to strange illusions.",
      "A hanged man rests on a lone tree. His pockets lined with petty change and a note that appears to be an apology letter to his family.",
      "For an hour of travel there’s no sound other than the party.",
      "A section of the forest has been frosted over in what appears to be a permanent winter. The center appears to have an unnatural cave of rocks that don’t match anything of the surrounding geological features. Inside features a drop that appears to be without end.",
      "A small portal opens up about 15 ft. above the party, expelling a blood lusted demon to the ground below. It bounces, stunned momentarily before it acquires a new target.",
      "A large head-sized knot in a tree resembles a human face. Wait! The eyes are real: wide, staring, terrified eyes! They look at you as you approach, flicking to each person that talks. But they cannot blink (so cannot communicate in that way), but constantly weep a watery sap.",
      "A large open area. The dirt seems fresher than the rest, no grass growing on the surface. The trees around the edge of the grove are burnt. In the middle sits (1d4) huge skulls, each at least 5 times the height of an average human. These skulls have gashes and claw marks in them, as well as huge spiraling or pointed horns. Scratched into the largest one is ‘entrance’ in infernal. If the player puts their ear to the ground and listens, they can faintly hear a low rumble that unnerves them to their very core and they don’t know why. Digging downwards could potentially reveal a connection between the material plain and one of the evil-aligned outer plains.",
      "The first character to awaken sees a grotesquely exaggerated face hovering inches from their own, glowing weakly with an internal light. An ear-to-ear grin splits the face, revealing a maw with three rows of serrated teeth. When the character blinks, the face disappears. It never appears again.",
      "The party comes across perfectly circle clearing. It’s barren waste, nothing ever grows there. Any flora the party might bring with them instantly wilts as it crosses the border. No animal, even as faithful as ranger’s companions, can be forced to cross into that circle. If the party decides to spend a night there, they will wake up outside the circle, with all their things scattered across the outer rim of the clearing. If they do it on the night of winter solstice, they will wake up in Avernus instead.",
      "The trees suddenly grow until the sun is blocked out and a magical darkness is cast from somewhere, and whenever the players talk, they hear their words repeated to them in their voice, but can’t tell where it’s coming from.",
      "The players slowly realize that they are on a loop in the forest. Every night they make camp, then wake up with supplies returned and make the exact same journey again. The players must find the source of this curse and free themselves.",
      "While the party makes camp, someone notices that there is an additional person around the fire. How did no one notice? Why does it smell like rotten meat? And why is it looking at the barbarian like that?",
      "In a less dense part of the forest, where moonlight pours through, the party witnesses a strange hulking creature (Mothman) perched on a tall tree. Its giant red eyes watch the party for a moment, before the creature flies away. The party sees the creature a few more times before coming to a large bridge built over a dangerous river. The creature appears one more time over head, just as the bridge collapses.",
      "After camping in the woods the party awakens to find the trees around them whipping and lashing as if buffeted by strong winds, though the party feels not even a faint breeze. Upon closer inspection, the party notices in mounting horror that the shadows cast by the trees are in the shape of human beings writhing in silent agony.",
      "The party comes across a 50ft circle of pitch-black darkness, with no logical reason as to its existence. Any players that cannot see when in such conditions hear whispers and chattering while in this area, and take 1d6 slashing damage for every round spent there. Any players that can see in such conditions (ex. darkvision) will not suffer any of these effects, and will see that nothing is attacking the others, but rather the wounds are manifesting onto them.",
      "You see corpses pinned to the sharpened boughs and branches of the tress around you, wood puncturing through their throats and sternums. The mottled moonlight filtering through the slowly swaying leaves gives them an eerie sense of motion. A sudden scampering and swish of branches punches through the soft rustling of the trees. Wherever you turn, the sound seems to be coming from behind you, getting closer and closer till you feel a hot, wet breath on the back of your neck. You swing around to confront the horror and see nothing but the corpses in the canopy, leering down at you like demonic piñatas.",
      "The party stumbles upon a clearing, with a post stamped into the ground. A message scrawled in Primordial reads about a treasure found in the hidden home of squirrels. With a few investigation checks, the party finds an odd tree. Around the back of the tree is a poorly hidden, though hidden, door. The door has no lock on it, but is not open; it has a feeling as though it is stuck. It can be forced open, or pried open, or cut open with fairly decent resistance. Inside is a staircase leading downward, lit by candles embedded in the tree that don’t seem like they’re burning the tree, though they are quite bright. After a 5-minute descent, the staircase ends in what appears to be a basement. The ceilings drip, and the room is damp and warm. (You can also narrate that the stairs are slippery, and have your players roll athletics not to slip). A decent perception roll can see that the floor and ceiling leak the warm water, without much of a source, while a really good perception check will notice that the color of the environment has become darker, and has a reddish tinge. Otherwise, there appears to be a library or study (whichever is easier for you to narrate.) There are no loose papers or pens and all of the books appear to be locked up, so that they cannot be taken out. A chest in the back can be found, a hair too conspicuously. Upon opening it, there is nothing inside but a pit, that smells of vomit and acid. With that, the room begins to shrink, slowly. The party should discover that they’re in the mouth of a giant mimic, who is swallowing them. Upon escaping, the entire tree uproots itself, spits and snarls at the players, and runs away. Best described if you can drop hints about descending the gullet of a beast, such as a hot draft, or distant gurgling.",
      "The party makes camp, and partway through the night, someone on watch starts to get an off feeling. Depending on perception rolls, they may or may not see the eyes watching from up in the trees, though they disappear just after being noticed. Additionally, they may hear the sound of leathery wings gliding through the air above them. Finally, after their defenses being lightly probed/tested, a creature attacks. (IIRC)I used a giant flying chupacabra from PF, but whatever works for you. The creature goes down relatively easily, but as it is struck down, it lets out a piercing scream. As quiet settles, the party hears answering cries from deeper in the woods.",

      "You fellas make sure to bring ink and parchment, you hear! I remember back, oh, 35 summers ago we found a crypt too big to tackle at the time so we decided to make a map. Only old Bark toes, well we called him Bark toes on account of being a druid his real name was Faelwyn (Sounds elvish but he was a Dwarf, damnedest thing really)... but anyway, old Bark toes had buried all our paper! Said it was only proper respect for Father Tree. So we had to hunt down a rabbit, tan the hide, then burn the map into it. Took 3 days, and that map reeked up my pack something fierce!",
      "Hah! That reminds me of a particularly harsh winter when a dwarf I traveled with thought it’d be fun to explore a cave despite us being low on rations. Needless to say by the time spring rolled around I was plus a few Bullywug bites and minus a short bearded friend!",
      "I wouldn’t eat that if I was you. I was once treated to the spectacle of what I thought was a Tabaxi coughing up a hairball. Turns out a Remorhaze egg had been incubating in her gut from some dodgy stew and she quickly became its first meal.",
      "You think this is bad weather? I’ve seen it rain so hard that you’d swear it was coming from the ground and the sky at the same time. My boots filled so fast I had to walk barefoot to the nearest shelter I could find. Nearly stepped on a gas spore.",
      "Well, let me tell you: you can take the mightiest knight or wizard in the kingdom, and they'll duel a demigod or storm the gates o'hell. But you throw enough angry chickens at'em, sooner or later they'll go DOWN. Buy me a top-shelf whiskey and I'll tell you how it happened to the high priest. It might come in handy later on.",
      "That's a good story, but I bet you never saw a goliath hurl a gnome into the maw of an angry froghemoth, the hard part wasn't getting the gnome out of the creature, she did that much herself. The hard part was getting the stink o' frog guts off of the gnome.",
      "Things are different these days, they are indeed. I was a Red Arrow, didja know that? Travelled all over these lands, usually in small bands but sometimes they were hundreds of us. Thousands! Everywhere we went we'd work to make people proud of their own accomplishments. Make 'em happy, even if they said our arrows were orange! And if they stole from others, or said unkind things, why we stabbed them with our cold blue spears to let the people know how to behave like proper folk!",
      "This? Just a bit o' mead from home. Like wine, but made of honey; there's a bit of rose in this one, I think. Want a taste? (If offer is accepted, the mead is described as being pleasantly sweet and smooth, if a bit dry. May cause heartburn for those with hearts.) Good stuff, innit? My uncle's favorite; it's basically all he'd drink. We'd usually get that mead with the juniper berries mixed in, but my uncle preferred the rose mead. Said it tasted better. Dunno if I entirely agree, but that's what he would bring over. Heh...I remember one year, he came by, strangely empty-handed. My mum (his sister) asked where the mead was. That's the thing, he said, they said they was out. Some damn fool had made off with the barrels, leaving none for the rest of us. He suffered through the juniper mead, but he sure as hell wasn't happy about it. But then comes next week, right? He comes by with two kegs of the stuff. THEY FOUND IT, he said. He said he'd been walking along when he heard a commotion off the path, went to go check it out. And, sitting on top of a cart, drunk as hell, were the thieves. They hadn't even properly made off with the stuff, they were just sitting there barely off the road. Damn fools. My uncle seemed proud of himself. Man loved his mead. Maybe a little too much...",
      "Hah! That's nothing! You want to know what 'up shit creek without a paddle' really looks like? Lemme tell you a story: Me and four of me mates (or so I thought) were going through the mountains with a big load from... I won't tell, because I might actually get back to that pile o' gold one day. But! We were going through this wicked cave, and suddenly drow, the dark bastards, jump out of the shadows and start shouting at us in broken common. Now, we're alone in the mountains, one weeks travel from any civilization, and ambushed by a crew of drow. That's the shit creek, now where's me paddle gone? Well as if the situation wasn't bad enough, there's a cave in that separates me from me mates (got Spencer's leg too), and now I'm alone against a dozen pissed off drow. Now, how I got out of that situation with only a dirk and a shovel to my name, is a story that there isn't a cup of mead big enough to buy from me.",
      "So there I was, tied up. Not 20 feet from this sorceress and her gaggle of cultists. As the I was cutting my way through my bonds, and trying to signal to my mates that we need to stop this. The cultists were Chanting, the clouds were getting darker and the villager in the middle of the throng was getting really nervous. But all I could think about was that damn sorceress. Anyway, that's how I met my first ex-wife.",
      "That ain't nothin' to be scared of. You ever been chased by an undead thunder lizard, vomiting zombies? I tell yah, that'll change the color of your pants and maybe even your religion!",
      "So you should have seen it: Me, the most beautiful woman you ever saw and a table that turned out to be a mimic. Her palms were stuck to the surface for reasons I as gentleman shall not get into, and I was swinging my sword with one hand and hitching up my trousers with another. Anyway that was the last time I snuck into the Wizard's college storage cellar to fool around.",
      "No crud, there I was at the Battle of Deepwater Isle, standing in front of the walls to Waterdeep. A hundred Sahaugin were storming up the bank, angry as a cat in a pond. We held them back, dropping them 3 to 1. Problem is, that wasn't fast enough and they just kept coming. Well, the Blackstaffs showed up on the wall behind us. Yah ever see what a Fireball does to aquatic flesh? It scared 'em, scared 'em right good but I tell yah, you never smell something so bad as burning water goblin! Except maybe troglodyte...",
      "That's some nice shootin' there. Did I ever tell you about the time I one-shotted an orc with my sling? See, we was jumped on the Trade Way, just a simple escort job. This little warband of orcs jumped us on the road, lookin' for an easy take. Didn't expect we all had steel, yah see? We cut 'em down quick, but one slipped away, with a sack of valuables under his arm. That greenskin nicked an ox, no lie, tryin' to ride it for all its worth. He was bouncing all around and not gettin' too far. I picked up a rock off the ground, loaded my sling, one shot in the back of his head and he went tumblin'; dead before he hit the ground.",
      "That's a fine bit o' gold there. Reminds me of the time I was prospecting for gold up north of Neverwinter. Mount Hotenow was still having its rumblings and we were pickin' pieces that size out of the rivers!",
      "Oh don't complain about this little drizzle. Did I ever tell you about the time I was sailing back from Chult? Musta been only a couple years ago. We had 3 ships, full of old relics, when a bad squall kicked up. Swells were 30 to 40 feet and rain was crushing down on us in sheets. We barely stayed afloat, and what's worse; Everytime the lightning flashed, we saw tentacles rising up from the depths. Only 2 of our ships made it back... (Looks off distantly, glassy-eyed in memory)",
      "Now that's a fine bit o' cloth. Almost reminds me of Owlbear fur. I tell yah, ain't nothin' better for keepin' back the winter chill.",
      "I once wrestled 20 trolls with my bare hands! Yep, you should have seen those 15 hobgoblins, they were no match for me. Once they saw my muscles, those 10 kobolds ran for the hills!",
      "You'd be surprised how many times an adventurer met their end from overconfidence. I saw a man that cut a giant in two with a single slice die after insisting the river only looked deep.",
      "Never ask a paladin about how their oath works unless you want an hour long moral philosophy lecture complete with some shameless proselytizing.",
      "Took us nine days to find that phylactery. The lich was pretty pissed when we showed him it. That was the fourth time we killed that ancient relic disguised as a man but that was the first time any of us saw fear in an undead's eyes.",
      "Get bent, young-blood. You don't know nuthin' bout no adven'turing. I know so, 'cause if you'd tell me a story 'bout what yuve seen and I passed my wine jug wi'out noticin' then I'd cut my luv'ely beard! And I. Dunt. Cut. Muh. Beard. Or share teh wine...' (Now the PC's have a chance to RP their characters telling a story of the experiences their character has had.)",
      "Say now, this reminds me of the time old Zollio rode a giant monitor lizard round the upside of a bridge to get a clear shot at the turtle dragon harassing us. Yessir, he was a sight to behold. Fell the whole way down and still managed to get the killing blow off that bow of his. I can't remember how we made it out of that one.",
      "So... you heard of the pale elf Drost Durden and his white tiger? He defied the laws of the over-light mountains, descended from their snowy peaks, and became a hero of the people. But thats just what the stories say, he is probably as cruel as the rest of them. (Note, there is a Dark Elf there listening to this story who looks very... very... very tired at listening to this)",
      "See this scar on my chin? The first deer I ever killed, I must have been 14, no 13. I waited for hours in a tree. Shivering in the cold, hungry as a dog. I pissed myself. Finally a young buck casually strolled up to my tree. I was so cold, I was scared my staccato breathing would scare him off. I raised my bow and my hands were shaking. Luckily it was directly under me. I couldn't miss. I let go and the arrow stuck him good in his side. It jumped up and buck a few times like a roaring bull. Then it hopped around in a a zig zag and almost seemed to lay down for a nap. I was young but I knew to wait a moment before approaching. I slowly climbed down the tree. I slipped the last couple feet. I sauntered over to the deer. I slowly kneeled down beside him. I took a moment to admire the steam coming off his body which some druids believe is the deer's life essence leaving this plane. I leaned in close to his face and I thanked him for his meat which I was about to consume. The deer pulled its head back and butted me right in the face. His antler leaving a deep gouge in my chin. He jumped up took a couple steps and again collapsed under its own weight. At 13 years old, I provided for my family that cold night.",
      "When I was your age, we had no idea that there were any other 'planes'. You were born on the prime material, and that's the way we liked it!",
      "When I was your age, we walked thousands of leagues to dungeons! Uphill both ways!",
      "Let me tell you something, young adventurer. Treat well you're boots for they protect you more than you know. That being said, I will never wear another pair again. I traded my boots for route sandals long ago, and let me tell you, I ain't putting on another pair of boots! I'd rather die! What do you mean I've used the same phrase twice in one sentence?",
      "If you suspect that you're gonna run into gnolls, just piss yourself! Hyenae respect the scent of piss. Makes 'em feel like they're messing with the property of someone powerful, ya know?",
      "I've never been a fan of 'preparing' spells. Back with the clergy of my youth, if you wanted a disease to be cured, THAT'S TOO BAD! YOU HAD TO DIE, JUST AS AMAUNATOR INTENDED!",
      "I never much cared for dwarfs. To stalky. Too hairy. What are gonna do with all that hair, hm? I don't trust it.",
      "Listen well. You need a danger word. I don't care about safe words or what you do with them. A danger word. Some things out there change their shapes. Mimic us. Hide the truth from your eyes. We had a rule. You found a way to work the danger word into conversation if your suspicions were up, but not your patience. 'Eaglepeak'. That was ours. 'Weather here is nothing like Eaglepeak.' or, 'The food here is worse than Eaglepeak.'",
      "One day I wondered off from my caravan to relieve myself in private. Just my luck I was ambushed by bandits at the worst possible moment. Then for the first time in my life I was happy to hear the raspy scream of an owlbear. The bandits all ran in opposite directions, the owlbear had pecked on of them really good and was in the process of turning him into a pincushion with its pointy beak. I pulled my pants up, again at the worst possible moment, and I slowly turned around and walked away, once I got far enough to not hear the pecking of flesh I ran.",
      "There we were, trapped on the bridge between the Harpies and the 4-armed Pirate-Gorillas, when Smendrik the Adequate (as we called him then) got the bright idea to cast Featherfall and Burning Hands through a barrel while we all stood on top! How we got the barrel is another interesting tale, you see it four years prior to then that we came across...",
      "One time we met a Dwarf who bragged that he could disarm ANY trap. So we find something that looks suspicious and we let him prove himself. He's sitting there for 10 minutes trying to disarm a weird little square of tile and a gout of flame shoots out of the wall next to him and sets his beard on fire! He runs around smacking himself trying to put himself out until our cleric finally extinguished him with a water spell. He stands there for a bit, beard half burnt off and drenched in water, looks at us and says 'just avoid that tile'.",
      "One time, a long while ago, Trudy and I were trying to nab some merchant’s permit from a fancy party and Trudy got made. So, to sneak her out, I hid her underneath my ball gown. We were both lucky my corset was big enough. Of course, leaving so suddenly would have been suspicious, which is how I spent 3 hours walking around a party with my sister under my dress. Thankfully, no one offered me a dance.",
      "Never step through a portal. Not once, not ever. My party went through a portal that was supposed to be a shortcut into a wizard's tower, right to the top. Promise of some quality wands in that tower, made us step through without thinking too hard on it. Five years later I came back to the Prime Material with no friends and no wands. I don't talk about those years. Just don't trust portals is all I'm saying.",
      "I won't stand for slander against Warforged. They got souls and I won't hear no arguments about it. No talk of 'tinmen' or 'automatons' at my campfire. You take that backwards thinking to your little farm and hang up your sword, because you ain't fit to be an adventurer. You fight with a 'forged at your back, or you listen to them talkin' about the friends they lost in the first war, and you would know. They might be more human than you or me. Certainly more human than an elf. Don't get me started on those knife-ears.",
      "Never wake a sleeping Gnome. I'm not kidding about this. Sure, you know not to wake a Barbarian, liable to get your arms chopped off, but Gnomes are worse. They can cast spells before they're fully awake, see? Still half dreaming. You haven't regretted a decision quite like getting polymorphed first thing in the morning.",
      "That flintlock you have there, may I see it? Ah, this reminds me of the rifle used by the infamous Tabaxi mage-slayer Odd Song Sung. I tracked that master assassin across this land, to-and-fro. Through battlefields and ruined cities older than you can fathom, yet she always stayed one step ahead. The last time I saw her, atop a tower above the street of Mordhau, eschewing her sights to read the charms she hung from the barrel of her weapon with fine chains as the winds of death shifted through them. I charged up those stone stairs faster than I have ever moved in all my days. But when I burst onto that damn platform there was nothing save for a single scrap of parchment held under a lose stone. 'Goodbye my friend' it said in a curling script, 'it has been an honour fleeing you'. I never saw that Tabaxi again.",
      "When you're in those swamps, never, I repeat, never follow the lights, I've seen what happens, some might drown in the muck, others might get ambushed by lizardfolk, those are the lucky ones, the unlucky ones, they get torn to shreds the fog itself ripping them to shreds like a butcher, so fast they don't have time to scream...I've seen things, are you sure you still want to go out there?",
      "... and so there 'e was when Oi' saw 'em, bold as a blacksmith strikin' hot-steel, 'e struck that demon on the fore'ead wif 'is fryin' pan! Oi'll ne'er outlive the day! Oi' outlived 'em tho' tha's fer sure, poor bloke 'uz ripped in 'alf shortly thereafter, e' wuz! But Ser Percivale 'e bought tha' rest'a us poor blighters enough time for Brofver Caedsmuire to Banish em, and tha's th' reason Oi' carry this f'oine fryin' pan on me belt, see? 'Sides from bein' 'imm-a-nent-ally prack-ti-cal', it's one-a-them 'Me-minty.. Me-minnow.. Me-mento Mor-as' and prack-ti-klee an ''oly relic'!",
      "I used to be a blacksmith, but I got run out of town after a string of unlucky lasses had bairns which looked a mite too much like me. I ever tell you the time I had to shoe the Lord of the Nine Hells' Mare? A Nightmare they calls 'em, and she tweren't no mare, I tells yah... well, anyway she were a mite skittish, and so I took hold of her bridle and trotted her a bit, and I tell you each stride of hers was seven leagues, and dragged me along for the ride, and each time she would stop at the house of a lonely local lass and t'wouldn't budge a step afore I had made a call, then after that mare she'd take another step (with me for the ride) to the next maid's cottage, and on and on you see...",
      "My party would agree but I was the worst bard they ever had. Let me tell you a story to illustrate how bad I was. So here we were taking the time to refresh ourselves in the city when we find out that the town is using some weird magic to keep the place going, some type of sinister version of Druid magic. So there we were investigating when my party member ups and attacks one of the guards because they were in our way despite all of us agreeing to be discreet. So in a panic and also because I felt bad for the guy I casted healing word in hopes of maybe getting the guards off our back by being nice. Well I took out my flute and blew the flattest note my ears have ever heard and I saw that man cough up blood because regardless. If that situation wasn’t so crazy I would’ve laughed my head off that I actually hurt someone with healing word but hey you live and learn and I needed a lot to learn.",
      "Wanna know how I got these scars? Biggest dragon you've ever seen...probably the ugliest too. Anyways me and my mates were hacking him up when he took a wild swipe at me because I insulted his gecko mother. So there we were, me in his claws at least 500 feet in the air. I wrench myself free, climb up to his back and give him a good one two, ride his lifeless corpse all the way back to the hoard. We crash and I am launched noggin first into this beautiful baby I've on my back right now. This greataxe cut me up nice that day, but all the best lovers do that's what I always say!",
      "You want to know where I got this sword huh? What if I told you I had to go the ninth hell and debate Asmodeus? Or the depths of pandemonium where I lost at least two friends and forgot one other? Mayhaps I got it from the githyanki pirates that killed my dog so I killed them all in return? Or maybe it was fashioned from the brain stem of the beholder that insulted my previous sword size? Perhaps I got it from the ancient vault of Dren'Dar the conquerer after we defeated his ancient blue dragon lover? Or perhaps I got it from Freaky Falzahad's Magic Emporium down the street? You'll have to buy me two or three more ales to find out, friend.",
      "Trust me pal, the best part of adventuring is the food. You ever had dragon stew spiced with the ancient herbs found in a tomb and the marrow of a direboar? Ugh... Speaking of direboar...the tenderloin with a little high altitude mashed potatoes gardened by an centaur? You havent lived friend. Or granita (fruit ice) made by various fruits you had frozen during a fight with a white dragon? Refreshment for days. I could go on for years my friend, but I have another dish calling my name, until next time!",
      "I lost this hand fighting sirens a mile off the coast, oh... ten years back, I reckon. I keeps a leather pouch of the bones to remind me of my mortality; each drilled and filled with a mix of tin, lead, and a shaving from a single sterling piece, blessed by a priest of Saint Quimbles; and etched with the runes. Shalls I cast them and divine thy fate?",
      "Best not to deal with nobility who ask for discretion in carrying out their tasks. Better yet, best not to accept a blabbermouth into your ranks. Best not travel to the shadiest part of town and loudly announce your search of information on an assassination plot. Best not to blindly follow the kind old gentleman out of town, as he knows the assassins' hideout. Best not to let your guard down and invite an ambush on your friends. Best not leave them to their deaths in desperation towards saving your own skin. Best not let your past force you into a life of running and hiding. Best not to deal with nobility who ask for discretion.",
      "There we were, about to be over-run by the damned, our backs against the fallen portcullis, when out of 'er satchel Sister Bloeddwyd Angelique pulled forth the candle prepared by the Holy-Matron and blessed by the Light. When she lit her taper, the candle shone forth a light fit to blind us! She placed the candle in the lock of the portcullis and a great flash and shout of a hundred wrathful angels blew us an opening! I'd not be sitting here telling you the tale were it not for her!",
      "Never underestimate a Kobold, ye hear? Me brothers in arms wound up as food in thier cook fires, and I'd be there too if'n I didn't high-tail it the moment I saw those first traps! Oh, aye, you call me a coward, but I'll ne'er go down any hole where'st I's s'pect them scaly buggers to be lurkin'! You's best be doin' the same as I, and mind yourself! Mark me words!",
      "Aye, nowhere, no place in this world leaves you weary as the blasting fields. Scores of brave men and women have been swallowed by the harrowed place. For what? Glory. Ha. Riches. What vanity we had. The earth rumbles with every step you take. The smell burns your eyes and the air takes your senses. Me and my mates, brave as we once were, never feared it though. We should’ve. We should’ve feared the jets of fire that shot out like columns holding the sky above. But we didn’t. No. We marched, knowing the dangers. Knowing the risks. Knowing the rewards. Damn our arrogance. If we weren’t foolhardy enough to turn at the sight of that place, we certainly hadn’t the mind to beware the creatures that called the place home. That’s where I found out how true horror felt. How it seeps into your bones.",
      "I was a hired by a small band of naïve adventurers to guide them through the mountain passes in early winter. We should have turned back when the skies began to darken. But the gold... The storm hit hard and a thick, heavy blanket of snow covered every discernable landmark. The storm continued without end. I soon lost my way but, I kept that to myself. Because, the gold... Wolves took two of them in the dead of night, one froze to death after falling through the ice, and the last one? After six days in that frozen hell, I was the only one to walk out. But the gold...",
      "(While tuning a lute) Have I played 'The Mouse and the Magister' for you yet? That used to be my specialty. Never failed to get the people clapping and the gold flowing. Now how did it go? 'La de da... mouse...' That's not it. When I played this for the Queen of Names she made me a knight on the spot. That's a true story. You can call me Sir, please and thank you. 'La de da de da... mouse...' Damn... Let me just play 'Sunrise Over Waterdeep' for you again.",
      "I'm telling you, first time I fought one it was called a Water Normal. That was many moons back now, you can believe that. Water Normals, used to pop out of wells in villages, just about every harvest, sure as the crops. Then a few decades go by and they're not so regular, we start to hear them called Water Uncommons. Over hunted, see? Nowadays you almost never see them. You worry much when you get water from a well? You're welcome. And so, yes, Water Weird, because they are now.",
      "Just sos you know, you can dance with the dead in the pale moonlight. It ain't the dancin' that's the problem, it's the leavin' after. Their grip is a might bit stronger than a clamp o' iron. It probably wasn't worth the gold my pals bet me to do it. (He/she shows off a huge scar). You should've seen the other guy, though.",
      "We once convinced a kobold colony to mine out a block of stone in the ceiling of a dragon's lair, dropping in on their head. Dragon problem done just like that, though, those damn kobolds did drive us out before we managed to take a share of the dragon's hoard...",
      "I only loved one man: Bernar was his name, and what a fine man he was. He could swing an axe like a twig, and drank brandy like it was water. I had to leave him, however... I took a contract to hunt down a hag. Turns out my suspicions were right.. it was my mother in law!",
      "Now, I COULD spend the next turn of the hourglass telling you lies about the best way to wield a longsword; lies I learned guarding the Duke, and learned were lies when the Masked Menace cut the Duke's Demon-possessed head clean off; but since you're buying me a drink, tell me a bit of your travels?",
      "Throws his drink at the painting of a wealthy nobleman. Noble my rear end! I've seen that man make love to a sheep after just 2 cups of mead. That ironbrained oaf still owes me 30 gold pieces too. I won it fair and square in a card game. He said he was good for it and I let him off the hook at the time but I should've taken his thumb as collateral and I woulda been justified to do it too. The healer I ran with at the time could've put it back on 3 weeks later in just 10 minutes I tell ya.",
      "That sure is a nice weapon you have there, young adventurer. But it's not about the size or value of the weapon, but the way that you use it. The older adventurer reaches for something strapped to their back and brings it into the younger adventurer's vision This here is 'Pointy.' My party and I were asleep in the forest one night, when I woke up surrounded by goblins and the sounds of screaming and crunching. No weapons, no armor, and my fellow adventurers were already as good as dead. The only thing nearby was this one strong, arm-span long, and unusually pointy stick. It must have been sent by divine beings that cast pity on me because it seemed to shine as I quickly reached for it. I picked it up, and I just started jabbing it at every goblin that came near me. Quick thrusts. I aimed for the eyes. I was there all night, and, just as I was about to collapse from exhaustion, the sun started to rise, and the goblins, many of whom were missing at least one eye each at this point, retreated. Ever since then, I have always kept Pointy with me to remind me that the most humble of tools can have the greatest of effects, to remind me of my lost comrades, and, well, in case of goblins.",
      "Speaking of alcohol, if you ever go to the Pinepoint Inn down the street NEVER drink more than one pint of their Hunter's Meade. I know it may be delicious, but I did it a couple of years ago and I woke up in a cave surrounded by a group of Kobolds who apparently started worshiping me as their new regent. Took me three weeks to get out of there! I can hold my liquor, but I'm never drinking Hunter's Meade again.",
      "The Icy Wastes are cold, cold, cold I tells ya! Only madmen and the darkest of evil travels there! I lost a hand and a leg to the cold, after I followed the Lost Prince and the Crusade to find the Egg! We found the Egg alright; it was beautiful, like a singular jewel, just sitting there on the altar of the Icy Temple, glittering for all to see! Then the men began to scream and freeze into place! I ran away, dragging my frozen limbs, of fifty men that went in, only three returned, and the Prince was not one of them!",
      "A cloaked and masked lady once hired us to take her deep into the woods, then bade us keep our distance while she spent the night alone atop a hill crowned with a ring of faerie stones. She never told us her name and commanded us never to speak of it. But do you remember the festivities when old Queen Gennereth turned out not to be barren after all? And isn't her daughter a rare beauty, like something you've never seen? Makes you think.",
      "Before you use your spell casting powers to win the affections of a fair woman or gallant gentleman remember the tale of the wizard Geniinewab. When Geniiwewab heard that the fair maiden Alessandra's beloved crow was ill he trapped all the town clerics in a forcecage so that Alessandra would be forced to consult him instead. In an effort to demonstrate his magnificent power Geniinewab killed Alessandra's crow with finger of death and then used a wish spell to revive it. The night after casting that wish spell Geniinewab caught the flu. Since the great wizard was enfeebled by the wish spell and all the town healers were locked up Geniinewab died within a week.",
      "Now, don't believe a word they say 'bout the moon being made of green cheese. I should know, I was there, me and my mates, you see, we sailed there one night when we were lost in a thick fog off the coast of Nuperie... Just remember when sailing, if you see a big fog bank roll in under a moonlit sky.. you should turn the ship right around and 'Nuperie' right out of there! Ha Ha Ha!",
      "My faithful hounds!', they's call us, their Majesties would! Why.. hold on, my neck itches.. would you scratch it? These old arms can't quite reach behind.. ahh! Oh yiss, thats divine.. that thumping noise? Oh.. sorry.. my leg does that when I get scratched there.. well anyway, they used their baleful magics to turn us into the very hounds they imagined us as, the party and I, you see.. we spent a good six years in that state, hunting the nine-tailed fox spirits! How'd we change back? Well their Majesties got offed by a party of adventurers, and wouldn't you know it, we changed right back to ourselves... Petersen though still had that awful case of magical fleas!",
      "Now now.. where's my pen and paper? I must certainly write down an account of your travels, they seem comparable or even to eclipse my own, most remarkable tales... most remarkable! Why, I too, recall coming up against savages, and thought my solution to be quite ingenious, you see, my party and I would replace the gemstone eyes of their idolatrous god with costume jewelry INDISTINGUISHABLE to the real thing... unfortunately, someone had already beaten us to the punch! The gems were fake the whole time! Oh, you should have seen Lord Perfidy's apoplectic face! He kept that face for the few moments of his life he had remaining after taking that savage's spear to the guts! Which, I daresay, still haunts me whenever I close my eyes for more than a moment...",
      "...that little spark and glimmer in a person's eyes when you JAB your blade into their GUTS and they are seconds away from slipping out of this reality? Oh, my favorite look indeed! Yours?",
      "Me? I knew th' 'Dread Pirate Roberts' back when 'e was just known as 'The Mildly Frightening Pirate Roberts'! T'was I what gave 'e and his 'ole crew th' idear to re-brand, I did! S'truth!",
      "... And THAT is the story of how I lost my leg! You ready to hear the story of how I lost my... oh what? Out of time? I'm sorry Children, that story will have to happen at another time! Good bye! Be good now, Children! So long! Byeee! Now, mates, where was I? Oh yes, the story of how I lost my right eye! It's a sordid tale involving the most beautiful ghost lady-captain I ever did see! Our love was one for the ages! I had my eye removed and magically enchanted to only ever see her, I did! And that was how I came to lose my Left Hand! You see it was shortly after...",
      "... and THAT, my friends, is why you don't go sticking ANY part of your AN-AT-OH-MEE anywhere near a mimic what looks like a KEE-YOOT little innocent stuff-ed an-ee-myool, no siree! Why that poor himbo over there lost more than one peice of his elf to that mistake! What? He looks fine to you? Why that boy is devastated! Devastated!",
      "Now, I'm usually pretty good with the ladies, no lie, but I tell you when I, in a drunken stupor, asked the Goddess Ishtar for a kiss, and got one! Why, I was over the moon! That night we made sweet, passionate love... you should have seen it! raunchy humping motions... but.. I feel I can trust you with this, the next morning, there was a donkey in my bed!! I never did see where Ishtar went, and now mere mortals just aren't the same. Ever since then I've decided to limit myself to just ten, ten drinks.. maybe twenty a night, so's the next time I see that Goddess, I won't pass out and get to see her afore she leaves...",
      "And on tha twelfth night, it 'as exactly as dark as on the 'leventh, but then BAM! suddenly tha' brightest light I never did seen came shinin' outta that tower and ALL the demons of Hell a'came a'riding out of it, it near sounded like.. the light made that much noise, jennle-men, I guarantee.",
      "When we moved to break into the block wall bricking up the secret passage, we found the body of someone who died trying to escape. Their fingers were worn to stumps and the back of the blocks were bloody. Never did find out what scared 'em so.",
      "All I'm sayin' is a good adventurer needs a good pair of gloves. Too many potion sellers don't wash their hands, and who knows what kind of poison is gonna get under your nails? And besides, if you hold your weapon without a pair, your palms will get all calloused. Mine are smooth as a baby's bottom, wanna feel?",
      "If you're ever in the deep forest, and come across a clearing you've not seen afore, empty save for a ring of mushrooms, turn around, and walk away. It ain't worth your troubles, believe me. You know how hard it is to escape the Fae? Damned bastards took me for everything I had, and I'm lucky at that. And this damned mark on my hand never did fade, either.",
      "I remember once back in my mercenary days, we were besieging this walled city... on a hill... on a peninsula. Perfect defensive position, right? Our employer was smart enough to know that a normal assault would have been suicide. So we just blasted the place with explosive spells. Days and days of hurling fire and lightning at those walls while trying not to get shot by their archers... I can still hear the booming in my ears sometimes. Eventually we brought a wall down and stormed the city. Damned messy business.",
      "It was the third month of the Long Cloud, by our reckoning. I was out hunting when I saw some shady looking folk around what looked like an altar. I laid there for a little, listening to them chant gibberish, but I knew I couldn't take 'em all in a fight. Left a few traps for the bastards, though. Never found out if they were behind the whole thing.",
      "Lemme tell you something kid, wizards are all fine and dandy... as long as they stick to the normal spells. But you ever meet a wizard who goes on about experimenting, and new forms of magic... you get out of there. Nine times out of ten that whole thing will end in a big explosion.",
      "These ales are practically water! A true man's drink can only be found in the Crested City. They use their crystals, ya see, and grind 'em up and put 'em in the drinks. Stronger and better than any other! I need to get back there some day.",
      "Aliases are healthy, kid! You give a false name when dealing with anyone that might want you harmed. Not to mention fairies and the like. I've got a dozen or so names you might find around the country! Of course this isn't my real one either. You really think my parents named me Mortimer?",
      "I don’t take drinks or food from people I don’t know. Got me in trouble quite a few times in my youth. I thought myself as quite charming, and tried making conversation with a Hag my party and me were having dealings with. Asked about the pot of soup she had cooking behind her, and instead of an answer I got a bowl full of the stuff. Well, I couldn’t just back down from a challenge, could I? It tasted alright, and the she told me about the slaad eggs she had planted in it. Told me I had three months before it would erupt and kill me, unless we went and got the scales of a black dragon for her. Lucky for me, I could think on my feet, and so I stuck my fingers down my throat and puked the monstrosity out onto her! Oh, she was raging mad, and my party was about ready to kill me after we fought her. But it all worked out alright, didn’t it?",
      "When the King did call for brave 'venturers explorin' the frontiers, I did answer the call. When the King did demand we'n all lay down our lives and clear these lands in 'is name, I did, and my wife and children too! And, when it were them what lost that life an' I forced to remain these 15 years past, what does the King and Crown do when dark-forces do gather and threaten all we have done? Does e' go reward our service? Does the Crown protect? Nay! The Crown abandons us! Mayhaps we should abandon the Crown...",
      "Fire, I says; 'tis your best friend an' t'worst enemy t'at the same time! Sees this scar 'pon me face? Flask of oil 'xlpoded afore I could throw 'er when the party and I faced off against that dark wizard Woss'zname? Frank!? Frank me boy, what was that wizard's name? The one where I got this scar strangling the life out of with these two hands!? Oh, Frank's asleep I see. Too boring for you, eh Frank!??!",
      "When Ser Porthe fell in battle off the far shores of Guthay, we saw fit to preserve the body from putrefaction by storing it in a cask of fine Canary that had previously been Ser's favorite. Seeing as not to waste any, as they likely took up quite a bit of the barrel, we shared a goodly portion with the fellow crew, before sealing. Now, I dare say, I scarcely can take a glass without remembering and mourning the fact that we still lack the golds required for their resurrection... Let's Toast to Good Ser Porthe! Ser Porthe!",
      "I came here to drink and forget the heaps of trouble my spouse lays upon me on a daily basis. Oh fer certain, I marched with the Lord against that vile Hag and their coven, but no matter how far we marched we could never catch em. Each night we lost a soldier or more, when they ran from the camp screaming of night terrors, we usually found their bodies in the morning... tell you the truth, Id rather be there than back home with the fractious family, some days...",
      "Loudest t'ing I never did 'ear, I confess, wuz tha 'splosion of tha Powder Stores on tha' Good Ship Lawbringer. Oh she brought tha law that day, I was on 'er, and she brought tha Law of Unintended Consequences! Shattered tha port, and collapsed tha channel, she did, and collapsed tha sea wall too! Lost us tha battle, and tha city when they gained entrance via tha hole. I managed ta survive, but I lost my hearing and was imprisoned and then enslaved for six years! Was a miracle and a steep one I paid for, when a travelling cleric healed me, and took me from that place...",
      "You 'kiss the toe' yet? S'posed to be a ritual, you know. A warnin' against those who dont pay their tab. I got a deal I did! Thats my toe, I paid my tab with it! You wouldnt mind buyin me a drink now, would ya?",
      "I tells ya, I saw FOUR, FOUR! masked Tortles down in those sewers! Meanest I ever came across. Scuffled with 'em once on a run for the society, see.. they kept shouting if I wanted a piece-a-them, well.. when I saws they were all armed, and with that tough shell.. well, I turned tail and ran. Now, don't go thinking me a coward now, when I found out they took down that Grell, that golem, and those masked warrior monks that worshipped it? Well.. seems I made the smart choice, friend-o; the smart choice!",
      "Y'all ever heard of the snail that wouldn't die? Once we were delving in a deep forgotten dungeon, looking fo' loot and other bits. Well we found some, a great big chest that was lock'd like sumfin tough. Well our sneakthief open'd it and there weren't nothing but single snail, still living but it didnt have no food in there. Little thing started to crawl out towards the north, ignoring everythin' we did to it. Scared me silly, still never did get us no loot from that place.",
      "... so trapped as we were and with days before help would arrive, we did what we had to to survive. I'm not proud of want we did, but I challenge any decent creature in the same position to do different. Anyways, I'll tell you something for nothing. Kobold doesn't taste anything like chicken.",
      "Once knew human. Skinny little thing she was. Ranger. Good with a bow. Obsessed with herself. Beauty treatments, strange potions. You name it, she'd try it. Got herself hold of some paste with flail snail muck in it. Rubbed it all over her skin. The next morning, she started glowing all different colours. Real bright like. Never laughed so hard in my life. Like watchin a magic show. Took us weeks and weeks to find a wizard to reverse the effects. Sometimes, when she hiccuped, she'd still let out a little burst of colour.",
      "All nobles are bastards, right? Only some are bigger bastards than others. Myself and a group of, um, compatriots got ourselves hired by a bunch of farmers to defend a town and a handful of villages from some hobgoblin raiders. Couple days in, we mange to capture one alive. Turns out the local baron was the one that hired them. He wanted to raise taxes and was using the raids as an excuse. Anyway, long story short, the baron ended up on the wrong end of a hobgoblin sword and the lads ended up being very well paid.",
      "Take my advice son, steer clear of fey. Don't mess with the little ones and steer clear of the big ones. Don't talk to them, don't even look at them if you can avoid it. Carry some cold iron on you, just in case. And especially, don't bargain with them. No good can come of it. There's a reason they call me 'Tails' and it ain't because I'm a good story teller.",
      "My arm? Did I lose my arm in the war? Well, let me put it this way young person. The next time a wizard tells you to keep your arms at your sides during a teleport spell, you do it!",
      "(Hoarse voice) Harum... I haven't cough... haven't seen much of folk in the past year, bit out of practice talking. But been out on my own since I uh... lost my adventuring partners to a wolf attack. (scratches their neck, a bite scar is visible on it) Biggest wolf I ever seen, tore through four of us like we was thin cloth stretched over bales of hay. Bowled me over onto a rock, hit my head and was out for I don't know how long. (clears throat and it sounds like a low growl) Came to and that beast was gnawing on what was left of my buddies, muzzle soaked in blood. I must've made a noise because it suddenly looked at me, eyes ablaze... (glances nervously at the moon breaking through the clouds) That was the unluckiest and luckiest time of my life. It jumped me, slowed down I guess from being gorged on my friends. Got its jaws locked on my throat but I got a hand up in time, saved me from getting killed instantly. (holds out a hand with deep, ragged scars all along it, highlighted in the glow of the campfire) Figured I was done for but my other hand happened to fall on what remained of our priestly fella. Whatever god he worshiped must've put his dagger right where I'd grab it. I just stabbed blindly. Maybe hit something important 'cause the creature leapt away like it was seared with a hot poker. (pulls out a fancy dagger, more ceremonial than practical, its silvery blade shining. The speaker's voice grows more hoarse, a barking cough escaping their lips) Kept it with me ever since... just... in... caaaaasse.... (And the moon breaks from the clouds entirely, bathing the campfire circle in its pale glow as the speaker bends double with a howl of pain as their limbs start to contort...)",
      "I got lost in a good book, once. Took me pages and pages to find my way out, and you ask me where my fingers on my left hand went? Paper cuts, I tell yah! Damn thing up and swallowed me whole while reading! Was my favorite book too...",
      "Strange lad? You want to hear something strange? Well, I adventured with this mage for a couple of years. He was a bit ... odd. Kept to himself mostly, very private and shy. Insisted on separate sleeping quarters. Mumbled a lot. We all figured, y'know, magic user. Weirdness. Paranoia. Odd behaviour. Strange smells. It comes with the territory. Too much mercury and bat shit in spell components. Anyway, we get hired by this prince to get rid of a gauth and when we tracked it down, the thing just laughed and laughed at us. Then 'gulp', it ate our mage, all in one go. Then, it spat out three Batiri goblins. One. Two. Three. Whole and intact. Damnedest thing I ever saw. When the gauth stopped laughing, he thanked us for the meal and entertainment and said he'd be moving on. Turns out, the little buggers had found some kind of enchanted cloak and had been sitting on each others shoulders. Had us proper fooled.",
      "Fundamental rule of adventuring my friend: always, always, always make sure your potions haven't expired. Knew this elf that left a potion of animal friendship in his backpack for a wee bit too long. We were trying to get past some wolves at the mouth of a cave, and he remembered this potion. Well, the wolves became friendly. A little too friendly if you get my drift. That poor elf, he had creatures coming at him from all directions. Spent the next few hours running around trying to avoid the attention of bears and bats and birds. Let that be a lesson to you all: test before you taste.",
